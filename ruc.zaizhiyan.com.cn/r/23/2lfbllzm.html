<div><b>Part III Reading Comprehension </b>(45 <b>minutes, 30 points, 1 for each)</b></div>
<div><b>Directions</b>: <i>There are 5 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are 4 choices marked A, B, C and D. Choose the best one and mark the corresponding letter with a single bar across the square brackets on your machine scoring ANSWER SHEET.</i></div>
<div><font size="2">Passage <b>One</b></font></div>
<div>Bored while waiting at the bus stop, Kate sticks a cigarette in her mouth just as she notices a billboard across the road. The small print reads, &quot;Warning: Smoking causes lung cancer, heart <span>disease, emphysema(</span>肺气肿)and may complicate pregnancy.&quot; Kate stops for a moment. &quot;How many have I had already today?&quot; she asks herself.</div>
<div>But then she lights up. &quot;I don't smoke that much,&quot; she reasons, to quiet her conscience. &quot;And anyway, I exercise and eat pretty well.&quot; Every day we wrestle with opposing viewpoints <span>that battle it out in our minds&mdash;a tension known as cognitive dissonance. Social psychologist Leon Festinger developed the concept in 1957, from the assumption that human beings fundamen&shy;tally strive for harmony in their thinking. In the face of contradictory paths, our minds attempt to restore internal peace. We strive for the reconciliation of two conflicting thoughts, even if we must resort to a third to attain it, such as, &quot;Gramps smoked a pack a day, and he lived to be 90.&quot;</span></div>
<div>Since Festinger's time, numerous researchers have shown how we attempt to reduce mental tension. To become truly content, it seems, we should favor smart choices over emotional ones, but even then, we may need to fool ourselves into thinking we have made the right decision.</div>
<div>Imagine you are looking to buy a used car. Two models stand out&mdash;a practical little sedan that does not use much gas and a stylish, fuel-guzzling sports car. After a good deal of back and forth, you decide on the sports car. But as soon as you have driven it off the lot, you get an ill feeling in your stomach. Shouldn't you have purchased the more efficient model?</div>
<div>Consumers call this feeling buyer's remorse. Psychologists call the tension that occurs after such decision making the regret effect. But cognitive salvation comes quickly. &quot;Don't be an idi&shy;<span>ot, &quot;you tell yourself. &quot;You'd be too cramped driving in that little thing. And the sports car has side air bags. And a CD player.&quot; The good features of the chosen car get bumped up in estima&shy;tion, whereas the bad features of the rejected one get exaggerated. Internal harmony is restored.</span></div>
<div>Researchers are finding more and more examples of cognitive dissonance.</div>
<div>In 2003 and <span>2004 studies by Michael I. Norton, now at Harvard Business School, and Benoit Monin of Stanford University unveiled a vicarious form of the phenomenon. In one exercise, </span>students who were waiting to participate in an experiment overheard a staged conversation in which an investigator convinced a student to present an opinion during discussion time that <span>would contradict what he believed: he was to speak in favor of tuition increases. Students who heard the coercion and later were part of the discussion voiced less skepticism about tuition hikes than they had previously. Apparently, the knowledge of their classmate's presumed internal con&shy;flict caused cognitive tension in them as well. The easiest way to restore equilibrium was to agree with their friend's stated position.</span></div>
<div>The potential for artificially inducing such attitudinal change is limited .nonetheless. Social psychologists Fritz Strack and Bertram Gawronski in a 2004 study of social groups found that al&shy;though we may change our conscious attitudes to justify contradictory behavior, our basic uncon&shy;scious thoughts and feelings are not easily remolded---even clearly impugned social views such as prejudice.</div>
<div>31. Why does Kate lit up a cigarette even she notices the billboard?</div>
<div>A. Such diseases as lung cancer, emphysema, does not affect her. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>B. She does more exercises and has a better diet than most of smokers.</div>
<div>C. She finds a good excuse to justify her smoking.</div>
<div>D. She smokes less than other smokers.</div>
<div>32. Which of the following factors doesn't contribute to cognitive dissonance?</div>
<div>A. Peace in mind.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Contradictory thinking.</span></div>
<div>C. Actions away from conscience.&nbsp;D. Battling viewpoints.</div>
<div>33. The author cites the case of buying used cars in order to show ______.</div>
<div>I. &nbsp;buyer's remorse is an ill feeling</div>
<div>II. how to avoid regretting once a decision is made</div>
<div>III. cognitive salvation can restore internal harmony</div>
<div>IV. how to distinguish between good features and bad features of a chosen car</div>
<div>A. I<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. II&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. II &amp; III&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. II ,III &amp;IV</span></div>
<div>34. Before the student in the staged conversation spoke in favor of tuition increases,_____.</div>
<div>A. he was less skeptical about it<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. he was against it</span></div>
<div>C. he accepted the investigator's opinion&nbsp;&nbsp;D. the investigator supported his opinion</div>
<div>35. Why did students voice less skepticism about tuition hikes?</div>
<div>A. Because they had cognitive tension as their classmates did.</div>
<div>B. Because they shared their classmates' opinion.</div>
<div>C. Because they were convinced by the investigator.</div>
<div>D. Because they wanted to restore mind equilibrium of their classmates.</div>
<div>36. In the last paragraph, the author points out that <i>________.</i></div>
<div>A. there is limited room for behavioral change</div>
<div>B. unconscious thoughts and feelings are hard to rebuilt</div>
<div>C. conscious attitudes are more difficult to change</div>
<div>D. such social views as prejudice can be easily changed</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Passage Two</b></div>
<div>Ben Mickle, Matt Edwards, and Kshipra Bhawalkar looked as though they had just emerged from a minor auto wreck. The members of Duke University's computer programming team had <span>solved only one problem in the world finals of the International Collegiate Programming Contest in San Antonio on Apr. 12.</span></div>
<div>The winning team, from Saratov State University in Russia, solved six puzzles over the course of the grueling five-hour contest. Afterward, Duke coach Owen Astrachan tried to cheer up his team by pointing out that they were among &quot;the best of the best&quot; student programmers in the world. Edwards, <span>20, still distraught, couldn't resist a self-deprecating dig: &quot;We're the worst of the best of the best. &quot;</span></div>
<div>Duke wasn't the only <span>U.S. school to be skunked(</span>因得分不够而被淘汰) at the prestigious computing contest. Of the home teams, only Massachusetts Institute of Technology ranked among the 12 highest finishers. Most top spots were seized by teams from Eastern Europe and Asia. Until the late 1990s, <span>U.S. teams dominated these contests. But the tide has turned. Last year not one was in the top dozen.</span></div>
<div>The poor showings should serve as a wake-up call for government, industry, and educators. The output of American computer science programs is plummeting, even while that of Eastern European and Asian schools is rising. China and India, the new global tech powerhouses, are fueled by 900 000 engineering graduates of all types each year, more than triple the number of <span>U.S. grads. Computer science is a key subset of engineering. &quot;If our talent base weakens, our lead in technology, business, and economics will fade faster than any of us can imagine,&quot; warns Richard Florida, a professor at George Mason University.</span></div>
<div>Software programmers are the seed corn of the Information Economy, yet America isn't pro&shy;ducing enough. The Labor Dept. forecasts that &quot;computer/math scientist&quot; jobs, which include <span>programming,will increase by 40% ,from 2. 5 million in 2002 to 3. 5 million in 2012. Colleges aren't keeping up with demand. A 2005 survey of freshmen showed that just 1.1% planned to major in computer science, down from 3.7% in 2000.</span></div>
<div>For young Americans, a computing career isn't the draw even a few years ago. Never mind<br />
that experienced programmers make upwards of $ 100 000 and that the brainiest of them are the<br />
objects of heated bidding wars. Students fear that if they become programmers they'll lose their<br />
jobs to counterparts in India and China. Analysts say those worries are overblown: Programmers<br />
with leadership and business skills will do just fine. But the message isn't getting through. Then<br />
there's the thrill factor, or lack thereof. Given the opportunity to make a mint on Wall Street or<br />
land a comfortable academic <span>job, many math and science students are turning away from soft&shy;<br />
ware. &quot;I couldn't really get excited about sitting in front of a computer and just writing pro&shy;<br />
grams,&quot; says Duke junior Brandon Levin, who has taken computer courses but is majoring in<br />
math and plans a career in academia.</span></div>
<div>37. Why did Duke coach say his team members were the best of the best student programmers?</div>
<div>A. He tried to encourage them.</div>
<div>B. His team did really well in the contest. <br />
C. They ranked second only after Russian team.<br />
D. They were one of the two home teams among the 12 highest finishers.</div>
<div>38. The result of the contest shows that _____.</div>
<div>A. the <span>U.S. is no longer a tech powerhouse in the world.</span></div>
<div>B. the government, industry and educators should be blamed.</div>
<div>C. American universities offered less computer science programs then ever did.</div>
<div>D. China and India have replaced the <span>U.S. as the major talent base.</span></div>
<div>39. &quot;A computing career isn't the draw&quot; probably means that _____.</div>
<div>A. it wouldn't offer a bright future</div>
<div>B. it is not attractive</div>
<div>C. is not a smart choice</div>
<div>D. its future is unclear<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></div>

<div>B. Students form India and China.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C. The most experienced and intelligent programmers.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br />
D. Programmers ever worked for Wall Street.</div>
<div>41. What has caused fear for students who would be future programmers?</div>
<div>A. Lacking in practical experience.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></div>
<div>B. Being less competitive with their colleagues,</div>

<div>D. Lacking in competent leadership and business skills.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></div>
<div>42. Many math and science students are turning away from software because _____.</div>
<div>A. they know they cannot do as well as counterparts from India and China</div>
<div>B. they have leadership and business skills</div>
<div>C. they find programming is a very boring job</div>

<div><b>Passage Three</b></div>
<div>Before high school teacher Kimberly Rugh got down to business at the start of a recent school week, she joked with her students about how she'd had to clean cake out of the corners of her house after her 2-year-old son's birthday party. This friendly combination of chitchat took place not in front of a blackboard but in an E-mail message that Rugh sent to the 145 students she's teaching at the Florida Virtual School, one of the nation's leading online high schools. The school's motto is &quot;any time, any place, any path, any pace. &quot;</div>
<div>Florida's E-school attracts many students who need flexible scheduling, from young tennis <span>stars and young musicians to brothers Tobias and Tyler Heeb, who take turns working on the <span>computer while helping out-with their family's clam-farming business on Pine Island, off Florida's southwest coast. Home-schoolers also are well represented. Most students live in Florida, but 55 hail from West Virginia, where a severe teacher shortage makes it hard for many students to take advanced classes. Seven kids from Texas and four from Shanghai round out the student body.</span></span></div>
<div>The great majority of Florida Virtual Schoolers&mdash;80 percent&mdash;are enrolled in regular Florida public or private high schools. Some are busy overachievers. Others are retaking classes they barely passed the first time. The school's biggest challenge is making sure that students aren't <span>left to sink or swim on their own. After the school experienced a disappointing course completion rate of just 50 percent in its early years, Executive Director Julie Young made a priority out of what she calls &quot;relationship-building,&quot; asking teachers to stay in frequent E-mail and phone con&shy;tact with their students. That personal touch has helped: The completion rate is now 80 percent.</span></div>
<div>Critics of online classes say that while they may have a limited place, they are a poor substi&shy;tute for the face-to-face contact and socialization that take place in brick-and-mortar classrooms. Despite opportunities for online chats, some virtual students say they'd prefer to have more in&shy;teraction with their peers.</div>
<div>Students and parents are quick to acknowledge that virtual schooling isn't for everyone. &quot;If <span>your child's not focused and motivated, can only imagine it would be a nightmare,&quot; says Patricia Haygood of Orlando, whose two daughters are thriving at the Florida school. For those who have what it takes, however, virtual learning fills an important niche. &quot;I can work at my own pace, on my own time,&quot; says Hackney. &quot;It's the ultimate in student responsibility.&quot;</span></div>
<div>43. Kimberly Rugh Talked about her son's birthday party _____.</div>
<div>A. with her friends</div>
<div>B. with her colleagues</div>
<div>C. in the classroom</div>
<div>D. in an E-mail massage sent to her students</div>
<div>44. &quot;Any time, any place, any path, any pace&quot; is _____.</div>
<div>A. what taken as the guiding principle of the Florida Virtual School</div>
<div>B. words placed at the beginning of a book or a chapter</div>
<div>C. a slogan put on the wall<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</span></div>

<div>A. the students at the Florida Virtual School hail from places in or out of the <span>U.S.</span></div>
<div>B. the students at the online schools can take classes at any time</div>
<div>C. the online schools provide a variety of training from tennis to music</div>
<div>D. among the students of Florida Vitual School, there are some very advanced or <span>backward ones </span></div>
<div>46. The challenge of the school is _____.</div>
<div>A. how to teach the students to swim well <br />
B. how to make the students more active in their learning&nbsp;<br />
C. to complete &quot;the relationship-building&quot; ahead of time<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
D. to urge the teachers to go to the office more often&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></div>
<div>47. The followings are the disadvantages actually present in online schooling EXCEPT _____ ?</div>
<div>A. It lacks face-to-face contact and socialization that take place in classrooms.</div>
<div>B. Some students prefer to have more interaction with their peers.</div>
<div>C. If students are not focused and motivated, it would be a nightmare.</div>
<div>D. Students can work at their own paces and on their own time.</div>
<div>48. What is the passage mainly about?</div>
<div>A. Online schooling is more convenient and efficient.</div>
<div>B. Online schooling lacks in face-to-face contact and socialization.</div>
<div>C. Online schooling is not for everyone.</div>
<div>D. An overall estimate on online schooling.</div>

<div><b>Passage <span>Four</span></b></div>
<div>Can an inventive society get bolder as it grows older? That question affects people of all ages&mdash;especially those living in the United States, Europe, and Japan, which are expected to have fewer workers supporting more retirees. According to <i>Science and Engineering Indicators</i>（SEI): 2002 ,issued by the National Science Board (NSB), America's science and engineering workforce will continue to grow in coming decades, but its average age is likely to rise.</div>
<div>Will scientific workers in their 50s and 60s continue to make valuable contributions? The re&shy;port avoided asking whether aging impairs creativity. If it does, then the growth of our produc&shy;tivity and improvement of our standard of living might be in trouble. There is already a shortage of young Americans in research; in 2003 the NSB expressed concern over the United States' de&shy;<span>pendence on foreign PhDs.</span></div>
<div>Scientists, of ten older ones, have for years questioned how long they can stay productive. <span>G.H.&nbsp;Hardy set the tone in his 1940 classic, A <i>Mathematician's Apology. &nbsp;</i>&quot;Like any other mathematician who has passed sixty,&quot; Hardy confessed,&quot; I have no longer the freshness of mind, the energy, or the patience to carry on effectively with my proper job.&quot; He continued that &quot;mathematics . . . is a young man's game.&quot;</span></div>
<div>The age lore of other sciences can be similarly misleading. The Nobel laureate physicist Paul Dirac has suggested, tongue in cheek, that a physicist over 30 was as good as dead, and the physicist-historian Abraham Pais wrote of Einstein after 1925 (when Einstein was 46)that, as far as his work went, he might as well have gone fishing. And yet the sociologist Harriet Zuckerman, in her landmark 1977 book, <i>Scientific Elite, </i>observed that U. S. Nobelists received their prizes for work done when they were, on average, nearly 39. Sir Nevill Mott won a Nobel Prize in physics for his postretirement research.</div>
<div>Great biologists seem especially hardy. The German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt successfully surveyed harsh, remote areas of the Russian Empire for goldfields after turning 60,and began publishing the 19th century's greatest work of synthesis, <i>Cosmos </i>,at <span>age 76;he had com&shy;pleted 2 000 pages by his death at 89,in 1859. More recently, Harvard University's Ernst Mayr was still writing papers at 100. </span></div>
<div>Why, then, do certain researchers stagnate while others flourish? Some might be internali&shy;zing what Zuckerman called the &quot;mythology&quot; of aging in science. But another factor is that any education has built-in limits. Even Einstein may have been bumping against them. Scientists over 40 face a choice: continue using the endowments that have served them well but are chal&shy;lenged by a new generation, or turn to new subjects.</div>
<div>49. SEI 2002 shows that _____.</div>
<div>A. in science fields the U. S. face shortage of talent</div>
<div>B. average age of the science and engineering workforce in coming decades will be higher</div>
<div>C. for old scientific workers, aging has impaired their creativity</div>
<div>D. the young Americans in research has outnumbered retirees</div>
<div>50. According to the author, the growth of productivity and improvement of living standard can&shy;not be made without _____.</div>
<div>A. the aged scientific workers</div>
<div>B. foreign PhDs</div>
<div>C. scientific elite</div>
<div>D. young engineering workforce</div>
<div>51. <span>G.H. Hardy in his book <i>A Mathematician's Apology </i>_____. </span></div>
<div>A. acknowledged the contributions of older scientists</div>
<div>B. thought that older scientists could still stay productive</div>
<div>C. believed that he was challenged by young scientists</div>
<div>D. confessed that age was a problem for mathematicians including him</div>
<div>52. From Sociologist Harriet Zuckerman's book we learn that _____.</div>
<div>A. the age lore worked for physicist</div>
<div>B. in certain science Nobel prizes not only belonged to young scientists</div>
<div>C. scientists over 30 were as good as dead</div>
<div>D. researchers flourished when they past 60</div>
<div>53. The stories of Sir Nevill Mott, Humboldt and Ernst Mayr show that _____.</div>
<div>A. old researchers can be Nobelists</div>
<div>B. researchers stagnate when they past 60</div>
<div>C. old researchers and scientists can made outstanding achievements&nbsp;</div>
<div>D. great scientists are those who are over 60&nbsp;</div>
<div>54. According to the passage, scientists over 40 face a choice.</div>
<div>A. to face challenge by young people or to retire<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></div>
<div>B. to continue their research or to work under new subject</div>
<div>C. to exploit their endowment or turn to new subject</div>
<div>D, to accept new challenge from young people or stay unproductive</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Passage Five</b></div>
<div>Do you know that all human beings have a &quot;comfortable zone&quot; regulating the distance they stand from someone when they talk? This distance varies in interesting <span>ways among people of</span> different cultures.</div>
<div>Greeks, others of the Eastern Mediterranean, and many of those from South America normal&shy;ly stand close together when they talk, of ten moving their faces even closer as they warm up in a conversation. North Americans find this awkward and often back away a few inches. Studies <span>have found that they tend to feel most comfortable at about 21 inches apart. In much of Asia and Africa, there is even more space between two speakers in conversation. This greater space subtly lends an air of dignity and respect. This matter of space is nearly always unconscious, but it is in&shy;teresting to observe.</span></div>
<div>This difference applies also to the closeness with which people sit together, the extent which they lean over one another in conversation, how they move as they argue, or make an emphatic point. In the United States, for example, people try to keep their bodies apart even in a crowded elevator; in Paris they take it as it comes!</div>
<div>Although North Americans have a relatively wide &quot;comfortable zone&quot; for talking, they communicate, a great deal with their hands&mdash;not only with gestures but also with touch. They put a <span>sympathetic hand on a person's shoulder to demonstrate warmth of feeling or an arm around him in sympathy; they nudge a man in the ribs to emphasize a funny story; they pat an arm in reassurance or stroke a child's head in affection, they readily take someone's arm to help him across a street or direct him along an unfamiliar route. To many people&mdash;especially those from Asia or the Moslem countries&mdash;such bodily contact is unwelcome, especially if inadvertently done with the left hand. (The left hand carries no special significance in the U.S. Many Americans are simply left handed and use that hand more.)</span></div>
<div>55. In terms of bodily distance, North Americans ______.</div>
<div>A. are similar to South Americans<br />
B. stand farthest apart<br />
C. feel ill at ease when too close<br />
<span>D. move nearer during conversations</span></div>
<div>56. For Asians, the comfortable zone _____.</div>
<div>A. is deliberately determined</div>
<div>B. measures 21 inches</div>
<div>C. varies according to status</div>
<div>D. implies esteem</div>
<div>57. It can be inferred from the passage that in a crowded elevator, a Frenchman would ____</div>
<div>A. behave in the same way as an American would</div>
<div>B. make no particular effort to distance himself</div>
<div>C. be afraid of bodily contact</div>
<div>D. do his best to leave</div>
<div>58. When Americans tell a joke, they of ten_____.</div>
<div>A. pat people on the head</div>
<div>B. give people a hug</div>
<div>C. dig people in the ribs</div>
<div>D. touch people on the arm</div>
<div>59. If a North American helps one from Asia or the Moslem countries across a street with his left hand, then the Asian or the Moslem may feel _____.</div>
<div>A. delighted<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. upset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. satisfied&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. depressed</span></div>
<div>60. What does the passage mainly concern?</div>
<div>A. It concerns distance and bodily contact.</div>
<div>B. It concerns body language.</div>
<div>C. It concerns cultural differences between the East and the West.</div>

<div><b>Part I<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Translation (30 minutes, 20 points, 10 for each section)<br />
Section A</span></b></div>
<div><b>Directions: </b><i>Translate the following underlined sentences into Chinese. Write your transla&shy;tion on the ANSWER SHEET.</i></div>
<div>(1)<u>However mean your life is, meet it and live it; do not shun it and call it hard names. It is not as bad as you are.</u> It looks poorest when you are richest. The faultfinder will find faults even in the paradise. <u><span>(2)Love your life, poor as it is. You may perhaps have some pleasant, thrilling, glorious hours, even in a poor-house.</span></u> The setting sun is reflected from the windows of the alms-house as brightly as from the rich man's abode; the snow melts before its door as early in the spring. <u>(3)1 do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there, and have as cheering thoughts, as in a palace.</u> The town's poor seem to me often live the most independent lives of any. Maybe they are simply great enough to receive without misgiving. (4)Most think that they <u>are above being supported by the town; but it often happens that they are not above supporting themselves by dishonest means.</u> Cultivate poverty like a garden herb, like sage. (5)Do not trou&shy;<u>ble yourself much to get new things, whether clothes or friends.</u> Turn the old, re turn to them. Things do not change, and then we change. Sell your clothes and keep your thoughts.</div>
