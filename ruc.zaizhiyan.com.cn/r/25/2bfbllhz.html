<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　<strong>Passage Two</strong></p>
<p>　　According to a recent survey on money and relationships，3 6 percent of  people are keeping bank account from their partner.While this financial  unfaithfulness may appear as distrust in relationship，in truth it may just be a  form of financial protection .</p>
<p>　　With almost half of all marriages ending in divorce，men and women are  realizing they need to be financially savvy regardless of whether t11eY are in a  relationship</p>
<p>　　The financial hardship on individuals after a divorce Call be extremely  difficult，even more so when children are involved.The lack of permanency in  relationships，jobs and family life may be the cause of a growing trend to keep a  secret bank account hidden from a partner;in other words，an&rsquo;&rsquo;escape fund&rdquo;.</p>
<p>　　Margaret&rsquo;s story is far from unique.She is a representative of a growing  number of women in long-term relationships who are becoming protective of their  own earnings .</p>
<p>　　Every month on pay day，she banks hundreds of dollars into a savings account  she keeps from her husband.She has been doing this throughout their six-year  marriage and has built a nest egg worth an incerdible $1 00，000 on top of her  pension .</p>
<p>　　Margaret says if her husband found out about her secret savings he&rsquo;d hurt  and would interpret this as a sign she wasn&rsquo;t sure of the marriage.&rsquo;&rsquo;He&rsquo;d think  it was my escape fun so that financially I could afford to get out of the  relationship if it went wrong.I know you should approach marriage as being  forever and I hope ours is，but you can never be sure.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>　　Like many of her fellow secret savers，Margaret was stung in a former  relationship and has since been very guarded about her own money .</p>
<p>　　Coming clean to your partner about being a secret saver may not be all that  bad.Take example，who had been saving secretly for a few years before she  confessed to her partner.&rsquo;&rsquo; decided to open a savings account and start building  a nest egg of my own.1 wanted to prove to myself that I could put money in the  bank and leave it there for a rainy day.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>　　&ldquo;When John found out about my secret savings，he was a little suspicious of  my motives.I reassured him that this was certainly not an escape fund that I  feel very secure in out relationship.I have to admit that it does feel good to  have my own money on reserve if ever there are rainy days in the future.It&rsquo;s  sensible to build and protect your personal financial security.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>　　37.The trend to keep a secret bank account is growing because .</p>
<p>　　A.escape fund helps one through rainy days</p>
<p>　　B.days are getting harder and harder</p>
<p>　　C.women are money sensitive</p>
<p>　　D.financial conflicts often occur</p>
<p>　　3 8.The word：.saIiw&rdquo;(Line2：Para 2)probably means .</p>
<p>　　A.suspicious</p>
<p>　　C.shrewd</p>
<p>　　B.secure</p>
<p>　　D.simple</p>
<p>　　39.What would Margaret&rsquo;s husband probably do if he found out about her  secret savings?</p>
<p>　　A.breaks up with her</p>
<p>　　B.builds anest eggforher</p>
<p>　　C.interprets this as a divorcing signal</p>
<p>　　D.escapes the wrong place</p>
<p>　　40.Which inference coil we make about Margaret?</p>
<p>　　A.She is a unique woman</p>
<p>　　C.She is going to retire</p>
<p>　　B.She was once divorced</p>
<p>　　D.She has many children</p>
<p>　　41.The author mentions Colleen&rsquo;s example to show</p>
<p>　　A.any couple can avoid marriage conflicts</p>
<p>　　B.privacy within marriage should be respected</p>
<p>　　C.everyone can save a fortune with a happy marriage</p>
<p>　　D.financial disclosure is not necessarily bad</p>
<p>　　42.Which of the following best summary this passage?</p>
<p>　　A.Secret Savers</p>
<p>　　C.Banking Honesty</p>
<p>　　B. Love I Wat it&rsquo;s Worth</p>
<p>　　D.Once Bitten，Twice Shy</p>
<p>　　The word&lsquo;protection&rsquo;is no longer taboo(禁忌语)&rdquo;.This short sentence，uttered by  French resident Nicolas Sarkozy last month，may have launched a new era in  economic history.Why? or decades，Western leaders have believed that lowering  trade barriers and tariffs was a natural ood.Doing so，they reasoned，would lead  to greater economic efficiency and productivity，which in turn would improve  human welfare.Championing free trade thus became a moral，not just an  economic，cause.</p>
<p>　　These leaders，of course，weren&rsquo;t acting out of unselfishness.They knew their  economies were the most competitive，so they&rsquo;d profit most from  liberalization.And developing countries feared that their economies would be  swamped by superior Western productivity.Today，however，the tables have  turned&hellip;though few acknowledge it.The West continues to preach free trade，but  practices it less and less.Asian，meanwhile，continues to plead for special  protection but practices more and more free trade .</p>
<p>　　That&rsquo;s why Sarkozy&rsquo;s words were so important：he finally injected some  honesty into the trade debates.The truth is that large parts of the West are  losing faith in tree trade，though few leaders admit it.Some economists are more  honest.Paul Krugman is one of the few willing to acknowledge that protectionist  arguments are returning.In the short run，there will be winners and losers under  free trade.This，of course，is what capitalism is all about.But more and more of  these losers will be in the West，Economists in the developed world used to love  quoting Jonoph Schumpeter，who said that&lsquo;creative destruction&rdquo;was an essential  part of capitalist growth.But they always assumed that destruction would happen  over there.When Western workers began losing jobs，suddenly their leaders began  to lose faitll in their principles，Things have yet to reverse completely.But  there&rsquo;s clearly a negative trend in a Western theory and practice .</p>
<p>　　A little hypocrisy(虚伪)is not in itself a serious problem.The real problem  is that Western governments continue to insist that they retain control of the  key global economic and financial institutions while drifting away from global  liberalization.Lock at what&rsquo;s happening at the IMF (International Monetary  Fund)The Europeans have demanded that t11eY keep the post of managing  director.But all too often，Western officials put their own interests above  everyone else&rsquo;s when they dominate these global institutions .</p>
<p>　　The time has therefore come for the Asians-who ore clearly the new winners  in today&rsquo;S global economy-to provide more intellectual leadership in supporting  free trade：Sadly，they have yet to do SO.Unless Asians speak out，however，there&rsquo;S  a real danger that Adam Smith&rsquo;S principles，which have brought SO much good to  the world，could gradually die.And that would leave all of US，worse off,in one  way or another .</p>
<p>　　43.It can be inferred that&ldquo;protection&rdquo;(Line 1，Para.1)means</p>
<p>　　A improving economic efficiency</p>
<p>　　B.ending the free-trade practice</p>
<p>　　C.10wering moral standard</p>
<p>　　D.raisingtradetariffs</p>
<p>　　44.The Western leaders preach free trade because</p>
<p>　　A.it is beneficial to their economies</p>
<p>　　B.it is supported by developing countries</p>
<p>　　C.it makes them keep faith in their principles</p>
<p>　　D.it is advocated by Joseph Schumpeter and Adam</p>
<p>　　45.By&ldquo;the tables have turned&rdquo;(Line 3-4，Para.2)the</p>
<p>　　A.the Western leaders have turned self-centered Smith author implies  that</p>
<p>　　B.the Asian leaders have become advocates of free trade</p>
<p>　　C.the developed economies have turned less competitive</p>
<p>　　D.the developing economies have become more independent</p>
<p>　　46.The Western economies used to like the idea of&ldquo;creative  destruction&rsquo;&rsquo;because it</p>
<p>　　A.set a long-term rather than short-turn goal</p>
<p>　　B.was an essential part of capitalist development</p>
<p>　　C.contained a positive rather than negative mentality</p>
<p>　　D.was meant to be the destruction of developing economies</p>
<p>　　47.The author uses&ldquo;IMF&rsquo;&rsquo;was an example to illustrate the point that</p>
<p>　　A.European leaders are reluctant to admit they are hypocritical</p>
<p>　　B.there is an inconsistency between Western theory and practice</p>
<p>　　C.global institutions are not being led by true globalization advocates</p>
<p>　　D.European countries&rsquo;interests are being ignored by economic leaders</p>
<p>　　48.Which of the following is true about Asians?</p>
<p>　　A.Asians have to speak out the protection</p>
<p>　　B.Asians have demand that they keep the post of managers</p>
<p>　　C.Asians succeed in today&rsquo;S global economy</p>
<p>　　D.Asians succeed by Adam Smith&rsquo;S principles</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Names have gained increasing importance in the competitive world of higher  education.As colleges strive for market share，they are looking for names that  proj ect the image they want or reflect the changes they hope to  make.Trenton.State College，for example，became the College of New Jersey nine  years ago when it began raising admissions standards and appealing to  students</p>
<p>　　from throughout the state.</p>
<p>　　&ldquo;All I hear in higher education is，&lsquo;Brand，brand，brand&rsquo;said Tim  Westerbeck，who specializes in branding and is managing director of Lipman  Hearne，a marketing firm based in Chicago that works with universities and other  nonprofit organizations.&ldquo;There has been a sea change over the last l 0  years.Marketing used to be almost a dirty word in higher education.&rdquo;Not all  efforts at name changes are successful，of course.In 1997，the New School for  Social Research became New School University to reflect its growth into a  collection of eight colleges，offering a list of maj ors that includes  psychology，music，urban studies and management.But New Yorkers continued to call  it the New Sch001.</p>
<p>　　Now，after spending arl undisclosed sum on an online survey and a marketing  consultant&rsquo;s creation of&ldquo;haming structures.&rsquo;&rsquo;&ldquo;brand architecture&rsquo;&rsquo;and&ldquo;identity  systems.&rsquo;&rsquo;the university has</p>
<p>　　come up with a new name：the New Sch001.Beginning Monday，it will adopt new  logon(标识)，banners，business cards and even new names for the individual  colleges，all to include the words&ldquo;the New Sch001.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>　　Changes in names generally reveal significant shifts in how a college wants  to be perceived.In altering its name from Cal State.Hayward，to Cal State，East  Bay，the university hoped to project its expanding role in two mostly suburban  countries east of San Francisco.</p>
<p>　　The University of Southern Colorado，a state institution，became Colorado  State University at Pucblo two years ago，hoping to highlight many internal  changes，including offering more graduate programs and setting higher admissions  standards.</p>
<p>　　Beaver College turned itself into Arcadia University in 200 1 for several  reasons：to break the connection with its past as a women&rsquo;s college，to promote  its growth into a full-fledged(完全成熟的)university and officials acknowledged，to  eliminate some jokes about the college&rsquo;s old name on late-night television  and&lsquo;'morning ZOO&rdquo;radio shows.</p>
<p>　　Many college officials said changing a name and image could produce  substantial results.At Arcadia，in addition to the rise in applications，the  average students&rsquo;test score has increased by 60</p>
<p>　　points，Juli Roebeck，arl Arcadia spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>　　49.which of the following is NOT the reason for colleges to change their  names?</p>
<p>　　A .They prefer higher education competition</p>
<p>　　B .They try to gain advantage in market share</p>

<p>　　It looked just like another aircraft from the outside The pilot told his  young passengers that it was built in 1964.But appearances were deceptive and  the 13 students from Europe and the USA who boarded the aircraft were in for the  flight of their lives</p>
<p>　　Inside the area that normally had seats had become a long white  tunnel.Heavily padded(填塞) from floor to ceiling it looked a bit strange.There  were almost no windows，but lights along the padded walls illuminated it.Most of  the seats had been taken out apart from a few at the back where the young  scientists quickly took their places with a look of fear .</p>
<p>　　For 12 months，science students from across the continents had competed to  win a place on the flight at the invitation of the European Space Agency.the  challenge had been to suggest imaginative experiments to be conducted in  weightless conditions .</p>
<p>　　For the next two hours the flight resembled that of an enornlous bird which  had lose its reason，shooting upwards towards the heavens before rushing towards  Earth.The invention was to Achieve weightlessness for a few seconds .</p>
<p>　　The aircraft took off smoothly enough.But any feelings that I and the young  scientists had that we were on anything like a scheduled passenger service were  quickly dismissed when the pilot put the plane into a 45 degree climb which  lasted around 20 seconds.Then the engines cut out and we became  weightless.Everything become confused and left or right.Up or down no longer had  any meaning.after ten seconds of flee fall descent the pilot pulled the aircraft  out of its nosedive.The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss.but  was still sudden enough to ensure that some students came down with a bump</p>
<p>　　Each time the pilot cut the engines and we became weightless.A new team  conduct it experience.First it was the Dutch who wanted to discover how it is  that cats always land on their feet.then the German team who conducted a  successful experiment on a traditional building method to see if could be used  for building a further space station.the Americans had 3.11 idea to create solar  sails that could be used by satellites</p>
<p>　　After two hours of going up and down in the lane doing their  experiments，the predominate feeling was one of excitement rather than  sickness.Most of the students thought it was unforgettable experience and one  they would be keen to repeat .</p>

<p>　　Most people who travel long distances complain ofjetlag(喷气飞行时差反</p>
<p>　　应).Jetlag makes business travelers less productive and more prone 6l making  mistakes.It is actually caused by disruption of your&lsquo;'body clock&rdquo; a small  cluster of brain cells that controls the timing of biological 62 .The body clock  is de-signed for a一63一rhythm of daylight and darkness，so that it is thrown out  of balance when it experiences daylight and darkness at the&lsquo;'wrong&rdquo;times in a  new time zone.The 64 ofjetlag often persist for days 65 the internal body clock  slowly adjusts to the new time zone.</p>
<p>　　Now a new a_nti-jetlag system is 66 that is based on proven extensive  pioneering scientitic research Dr.Martin Moore-Ede has devised a practical  strategy to adjust the body clock much sooner to the new time zone 67 controlled  exposure to bright light.The time zone shift is easy to</p>
<p>　　accomplish and eliminates 68 of the discomfort ofjetlag.</p>
<p>　　A succesful time zone shift depends on knowing the exact times to either 69  or avoid bright light.Exposure to light at the wrong time can actually make  jetlag worse.The proper schedule 70 light exposure depends a great deal 011 7l  travel plans.Data on a specific flight itinerary(旅行路线)and the individual&rsquo;s sleep  72 are used to produce a Trip Guide with 73 .on exactly when to be exposed to  bright light.</p>
<p>　　Whell the Trip Guide calls 74 bright light you should spend time outdoors  if possible.If it is dark outside，or the weather is bad， 75 you are on an  aeroplane，you Carl use a special light device to provide the necessary light  stimulus for a range of activities such as reading，watching TV or working.</p>

<p>　　我希望，我们本着坦诚的精神来进行本周的谈话，让我们从一开始就认识到这样几</p>
<p>　　点：过去，我们有的时候是敌人，至今还有分歧。我们之所以能走到一起是因为我们拥有超越这些分歧的共同利益。我们在谈论分歧的时候，双方都不会屈服于对方。但是，我们虽然不能消除我们之间的分歧，我们却可以搭一座桥，以便于跨越这座桥来进行对话。</p>
<p>　　Section B</p>
<p>　　A country with a vast territory，a large population and a long history，China  should make</p>
<p>　　greater contribution to humanity.The Chinese people waged a dauntless  struggle for one hundred years.They have effected great reform and changes one  after another to build China into a strong and prosperous country.They have  worked to strengthen ethnic solidarity and achieve national reunification and to  promote the lofty cause of world peace and development.In the final  analysis，they have done all for just one objective，that is，the great  rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and China&rsquo;S new and great contribution to  humanity</p>
<p>　　Part II Writing(Suggested)</p>
<p>　　参考范文：</p>
<p>　　On Sandstorms</p>
<p>　　These ore two ordinary but meaningful photos.As we can see in the first  one，dust and sand are attacking a village like high waves.Imaginably，the village  will soon be drowned.In the second picture，a city has already been assaulted by  a sandstorm，with the buildings and traffic barely visible.</p>
<p>　　Simple as the photos are，the message they convey is profound and  far-reaching.The disastrous weather conditions as reflected by the photos are  prevalent in northern China and some ther parts of the world.A number of factors  could account for the rampancy of sandstorms，but the most critical ones might be  overgrazing and clear-cutting，which have devastated the vegetation in formerly  green mountains and plains.Consequently，desert has spread and become the major  source of sandstorms.If the situation goes as it is.the consequence will be  disastrous .</p>
<p>　　In view of the seriousness of the problem，effective measures must be taken  immediately before things get worse.In the first place，it is imperative that  pertinent laws be worked out and rigidly enforced to protect vegetation.In the  second place，a deep-going，widespread and ever- lasting campaign should be  launched to enhance people&rsquo;S awareness of environmental protection. With proper  laws and 3.11 alert public，it will only be a matter of time before sandstorms  become things of the past.</p>
