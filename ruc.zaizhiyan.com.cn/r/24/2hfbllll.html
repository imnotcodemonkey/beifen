For each of them there are 4 choices marked A, B, C and D.&nbsp; Choose the best one and mark the corresponding letter with a single bar across the square brackets on your machine scoring ANSWER SHEET.<br />
Passage One<br />
The National Education Association claims. &ldquo;The school bus is a mirror of the community.&rdquo; They further add that, unfortunately, what appears on the exterior does not always reflect the reality of a chosen community. They are right---sometimes it reflects more! Just ask Liesl Denson. Riding the school bus has been more than a ride to school for Liesl.<br />
Bruce Hardy, school bus driver for Althouse BUS Company, has been Liesl&rsquo;s bus driver since kindergarten. Last year when Liesl&rsquo;s family moved to Parkesburg, knowing her bus went by her new residence, she requested to ride the same bus. This year Liesl is a senior and will enjoy her last year riding the bus. She says,&rdquo; It&rsquo;s been a great ride so far! My bus driver is so cool and has always been a good friend and a good listener. Sometimes when you&rsquo;re a child adults do not think that what you have to say is important. Mr. Hardy always listens to what you have to say and makes you feel important.&rdquo; Her friends Ashley Batista and Amanda Wolfe agree.<br />
Bruce Hardy has been making Octorara students feel special since 1975. This year he will celebrate 30 years working for Althouse Bus Company, Larry Althouse, president of the company, acknowledges Bruce Hardy&rsquo;s outstanding record: &ldquo;You do not come by employees like Bruce these days. He has never missed a day of work and has a perfect driving record. He was recognized in 2000 by the Pennsylvania School Bus Association for driving 350 000 accident free miles. Hardy&rsquo;s reputation is made further evident through the relationships he has made with the students that ride his bus.&rdquo; <br />
Althouse further adds, &ldquo;Althouse Bus Company was established 70 years ago and has been providing quality transportation ever since. My grandfather started the business with one bus.&rdquo;<br />
Althouse Bus Company is delighted to have the opportunity to bring distinctive and safe service to our local school and community and looks forward to continuing to provide quality service for many more years to come.&rdquo;<br />
Three generations of business is not all the company has enjoyed. Thanks to drivers like Bruce Hardy, they have been building relationships through generations; Liesl&rsquo;s mother Carol also enjoys fond memories of riding Bruce Hardy&rsquo;s bus to the Octorara School District.<br />

Passage Two<br />
Despite not being terribly smart as individuals, wasp (黄蜂) colonies build and maintain a complex nest that lasts many generations. Just how these social wasps coordinate this task has always been a mystery. But now a mathematical model suggests that one key factor drives their behavior: the amount of water in the nest.<br />
Social wasps cannot learn from one another --- unlike bees, which use a complex dance to tell nest mates where sources of nectar (花蜜) are . Nor do they use pheromones (信息素) the way ants do to lead other ants to food.<br />
Robert Jeanne of the University of Wisconsin-Madison proposed that wasps set up a demand-driven chain of information. At the end of the chain, builder wasps monitor the nest and when necessary, request pulp from pulp forager wasps. They in turn demand water from water foragers in order to make the pulp.<br />
But biologist Istvan Karsai of East Tennessee State University in Johnson City, Tennessee, and his team found that social wasps in Panama don&rsquo;t actually work that way. They removed either builders or pulp foragers from a colony of a species, called Metapolybia aztecoides. Although that should break up the so-called information chain, it did not significantly alter the amount of water being brought into the nest. They also found that the wasps could change roles, something that Jeanne didn&rsquo;t expert. For instance, when the researchers sprayed a surplus of water onto the nest, water foragers quickly became builders, and nest building increased.<br />
Based on their observations, Karsai&rsquo;s team developed a mathematical model that shows that wasps achieve their complex behavior simply by monitoring the level of water in the nest &mdash; what he calls the &ldquo;common stomach&rdquo; of the colony. He believes wasps infer what the level is when they exchange fluids on meeting each other, a behavior called trophallaxis that is common in many social insects.<br />
To test the model, Karsai simulated changes in the model colony, for example by removing pulp foragers or builders. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting is that in every case the model responds like the actual colony in Panama, &ldquo;says Karsai.<br />
37. According to the passage wasps _____ .<br />
A. are very smart as individuals<br />
B. are able to build and maintain complex nests<br />
C. drink more water than scientists have expected<br />
D. can learn from each other just like the bees<br />
38. What can we infer from the first two paragraphs?<br />

B. Wasps have nothing in common with bees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Unlike bees, wasps live in colonies.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
D. Wasps use pheromones to lead other wasps to food.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
39. Robert Jeanne believes that _____.<br />
A. the wasps colonies are the ideal social colonies<br />
B. wasps have very strict hierarchical classes<br />
C. wasps&rsquo; behaviors depend on their demands<br />
D. builder wasps have a higher status than pulp forager wasps<br />
40. Istvan Karsai and his team have found that _____.<br />
A. water distribution in the wasps colonies is based on the kind of job the wasps are doing <br />
B. when the information chain is broken up in the wasps colonies, the amount of water decreases <br />
C. when a surplus of water is sprayed onto the wasps nest, the water foragers refuse to work <br />
D. wasps change roles according to the situations in the nests<br />
41. The word &ldquo;trophallaxis&rdquo; is closest in meaning to _____.<br />
A. the level of water in the nest&nbsp; <br />
B. the common stomach of the colony<br />
C. the exchange of fluids on meeting each other<br />
D. common social insects<br />
42. The following statements are related to the mathematical model developed by Karsai&rsquo;s team EXCEPT that _____.<br />
A. wasps achieve their complex behavior simply by monitoring the level of water in the nest<br />
B. what Karsai calls the &ldquo;common stomach&rdquo; of the colony<br />
C. wasps infer what the level is when they exchange fluids on meeting each other<br />
D. common in many social inserts</p>
<p>Passage Three<br />
Have you ever felt your life go into slow motion as you realize something bad is happening? You might have just knocked over a wine glass or noticed a car hurtling towards you, for example. Now scientists have measured exactly how much these attention-grabbing(引人注意的) events slow down our perception of the world around us.<br />
Another example of the world appearing to slow down is when you are hanging on the phone waiting for someone to pick up at the other end. If your attention wanders while you&rsquo;re waiting, then suddenly switches back, you will probably hear what seems like a longer than usual silence before hearing the dialing tone again. For you, time will have momentarily slowed.<br />
To see how our perception of time changes when something new happens, Vincent Walsh and his colleagues put headphones on volunteers and played eight beeps to their right ears. The gap between each beep was exactly 1 second, except for the gap between the fourth and fifth beeps, which the scientists could make shorter or longer. They altered the length of this gap until the volunteers estimated it was the same length as the other gaps. The researchers found that, on average, people judge a second slightly short, at 955 milliseconds.<br />
In the second part of the experiment, the first four beeps were played to the subjects&rsquo; right ear, but the other four were then played to their left. Again, the volunteers were asked to esti&not;mate when the gap between the fourth and fifth beeps was the same as the others. This time they judged a second to be even shorter at 825 milliseconds long.<br />
Perceiving a second to be much shorter than it is makes you feel as though the world has gone into slow motion, since less happens in that slice of time. Walsh thinks the effect could have evolved to give us a fraction more time to react to potentially threatening events.<br />
Last year, Kielan Yarrow, a British psychologist found a similar effect with vision. When you glance at a clock, the first second will seem longer than it really is.<br />
Yarrow&rsquo;s results showed that time appeared to slow down by a similar amount as Walsh found. Previous studies have shown that cooling the body slows down our perception of time while warming it up has the opposite effect.<br />

<p>Passage Four<br />
A nocturnal (夜间活动的) moth has become the first animal known to see colors in the dead of night. The moth uses this visual talent to find yellow, nectar-packed flowers in the dark, but the finding suggests that other species also use color vision at night.<br />
Nocturnal moths were thought to find flowers by looking for bright petals against a darker, leafy background. This difference in brightness explains why a yellow flower stands out from green leaves on a black and white photo.<br />
To test this idea, researchers at Lund University in Sweden trained nocturnal elephant hawkmoths (豆天蛾) to pick out yellow or blue artificial flowers from eight other flowers of varying shades of grey. They then made moths perform the trick in conditions as dark as a starry but moonless night.<br />
The researchers expected the moths to do badly, but to their surprise the insects picked the correct flower 90 per cent of the time. But the moths could not distinguish between lighter and darker shades of a colored flower, even though they could still tell both from grey. &ldquo;This tells us it&rsquo;s not a brightness-related cue,&rdquo; says Almut Kelber, the sensory biologist leading the Lund team. &ldquo;They could only have used the spectral(光谱) composition of the signals---which we call color.&rdquo;<br />
The moths use three separate color receptors: blue, green and ultraviolet. At night, that leaves so little light per receptor that the insects should be almost blind. But hawkmoths have a host of adaptations to compensate. One is a mirror-like structure at the base of the eye, which reflects the light across the photoreceptors for a second time. The structure of the compound eye also allows each facet to supplement the light that strikes it with light from as many as 600 others.<br />
Kelber suspects that many other insects, and some higher animals, also use color vision at night. She plans to look for the ability in nocturnal frogs and toads that use color to choose their mate. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she asks. &ldquo;At night there are just as many colors as during the day.&rdquo; <br />
49. Which of the following might be the most appropriate title for this passage? <br />
A. How animals see things at night.<br />
B. Moth&mdash;the only creature to see things at night.<br />
C. Moths use color to see flowers at night. <br />
D. How many colors can moths see at night.<br />
50. Why does yellow flower stand out from green leaves on a black and white photo?<br />
A. Because it is brighter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Because it receives more focus.<br />
C. Because it is more beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. Because it has petals.<br />
51. Which of the following did the researchers find according to paragraph 4? <br />
A. Moths could only pick out real flowers, not the artificial ones.<br />
B. Moths picked out the correct flowers by their brightness. <br />
C. Moths couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference between blue flowers and gray flowers.<br />
D. Moths picked out the correct flowers by their color. <br />
52. Which of the following insect is different from others at night? <br />
A. frog&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. toad&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. hawkmoth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. bee <br />
53. According to the passage, which of the following statements is true? <br />
A. Moths are blind insects at daytime.<br />
B. Moths use their color receptors only at night. <br />
C. Moths have special structure at the base of the eye. <br />
D. Moths can see color only at night. .<br />
54. Kelber believes that nocturnal frogs and toads _____.&nbsp; <br />

Passage Five<br />
By 2010, half the recoverable material in Britain&rsquo;s dustbins will be recycled---that, at least, was the target set by Chris Patten, Secretary of State for the Environment. But he gave no clues as to how Britain should go about achieving it. While recycling enthusiasts debate the relative merits of different collection systems, it will largely be new technology, and the opening up of new markets, that makes Patten&rsquo;s target attainable; a recycling scheme is successful only if manufacturers use the recovered materials in new products that people want to buy.<br />
The first question is how best to separate clean element---glass containers, plastics, and some paper and metal containers that is relatively clean when discarded---from mixed refuse. This clean element is the main target for Britain&rsquo;s recyclers. The method of collection is imporant because manufacturers will not reuse collected material unless it is clean and available in sufficient quantities. A bewildering assortment of different collection schemes operates in the rest of Europe, and pilot schemes are now under way in many British cities.<br />
A realistic target for recycling mixed refuse is somewhere between 15 and 25 percent by weight, according to researchers at the Department of Trade and Industry&rsquo;s Laboratory. Statistics compiled by researchers at the University of East Anglia show that Britain could almost halve the total weight of domestic waste going to landfill by a combination of &ldquo;collect&rdquo; schemes(such as doorstep collections for newspapers) , &ldquo;bring&rdquo; schemes (such as bottle banks) and plants for extrac&not;ting metals. <br />
This estimate makes two important assumptions. One is that the government will bring in legislation to encourage the creation of markets for products made from recycled materials, especially glass, paper and plastics. The other is that industry will continue to introduce new technology that will improve both the products and the techniques used to separate recoverable materials from mixed refuse.<br />
55. Which of the following can serve as a proper title for the passage?<br />
A. An Impossible Target&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
B. Government Assumptions&nbsp; <br />
C. Recycling Britain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

Most people feel the need to make sure everyone in a group is comfortable before they start a business meeting. This pre-discussed conversation&mdash;small talk&mdash;can cover a wide range of topics, some of 61 may not be related to agenda for the meeting. In most countries, building personal connections is a 62 first step in making sure that business goes 63&nbsp; . People often use this phase of interaction to observe and 64 the character of their colleagues.<br />
In the Middle East, business men like to get to know new 65 before starting a meet&not;ing. They often judge people&rsquo;s response to certain topics by observing their eyes, 66&nbsp; they need to be able to sit or stand very close to the person. Small talk tends to continue until the people involved are comfortable enough to move close to one 67 .In Latin American and Asian countries, people also want to 68 if an acquaintance can be trusted. For them, busi&not;ness is 69 with an individual, not a company, so it&rsquo;s important to have an honest 70 before any business is discussed.<br />
In the United States, 71 ,most business people prefer an extremely limited small talk period. When they arrive for a meeting, they expect to begin the business discussion 72 away, perhaps after just a few minutes of greetings and 73 Most Americans feel that time is as valuable as 74&nbsp; ,so talking extensively about the weather, hobbies, or the plane trip is 75 as a waste of time. They are likely to become impatient if the subject turns away from the business of the day.</p>

Section A<br />
Directions:&nbsp; Translate the following passage into Chinese. Write your translation on the ANSWER SHEET.<br />
A new era is upon us. Call it what you will: the service economy, the information age, the knowledge society. It all translates to a fundamental change in the way we work. Already we&rsquo;re partly there. (l)The percentage of people who earn their living by making things has fallen dramatically in the Western World. Today the majority of jobs in America, Europe and Japan (two thirds or more in many of these countries)are in the service industry, and the number is on the rise.&nbsp; (2)There are more part-time jobs. More people are self-employed. But the breadth of the economic transformation can&rsquo;t be measured by numbers alone, because it also is giving rise to a radical new way of thinking about the nature of work itself.&nbsp; (3)Long-held notions about jobs and careers, the skills needed to succeed, even the relation between individuals and employers&mdash;all these are being challenged. (4)We have only to look behind us to get some sense of what may lie ahead. (5)No one looking ahead 20 years possibly could have foreseen the ways in which a single invention, the chip, would transform our world thanks to its applications in personal computers, digital communications and factory robots.&nbsp;.</p>
