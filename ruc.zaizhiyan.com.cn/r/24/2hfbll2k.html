<p>Part III&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading Comprehension (45 minutes, 30 points, I for each)<br />
Directions: There are 5 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are 4 choices marked A, B, C and D. Choose the best one and mark the corresponding letter with a single bar across the square brackets on your machine scoring ANSWER SHEET.<br />
Passage One<br />
&ldquo;Humans should not try to avoid stress any more than they would shun food, love or exer&not;cise.&rdquo; said Dr. Hans Selye, the first physician to document the effects of stress on the body. While here&rsquo;s no question that continuous stress is harmful, several studies suggest that challeng&not;ing situations in which you&rsquo;re able to rise to the occasion can be good for you.<br />
In a 2001 study of 158 hospital nurses, those who faced considerable work demands but coped with the challenge were more likely to say they were in good health than those who felt they couldn&rsquo;t get the job done.<br />
Stress that you can manage may also boost immune(免疫的)function. In a study at the Academic Center for Dentistry in Amsterdam, researchers put volunteers through two stressful experiences. In the first, a timed task that required memorizing a list followed by a short test, subjects believed they had control over the outcome. In the second, they weren&rsquo;t in control: They had to sit through a gory(血淋淋的) video on surgical procedures. Those who did go on the memory test had an increase in levels of immunoglobulin(免疫球蛋白) A, an antibody that&rsquo;s the body&rsquo;s first line of defense against germs. The video-watchers experienced a downturn in the antibody.<br />
Stress prompts the body to produce certain stress hormones. In short bursts these hormones have a positive effect, including improved memory function. &ldquo;They can help nerve cells handle information and put it into storage,&rdquo; says Dr. Bruce McEwen of Rockefeller University in New York. But in the long run these hormones can have a harmful effect on the body and brain.<br />
&ldquo;Sustained stress is not good for you,&rdquo; says Richard Morimoto, a researcher at Northwest&not;ern University in Illinois studying the effects of stress on longevity (长寿) , &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the occasional burst of stress or brief exposure to stress that could be protective. &ldquo;<br />
31. The passage is mainly about _____. <br />
A. the benefits of manageable stress<br />
B. how to avoid stressful situations<br />
C. how to cope with stress effectively<br />
D. the effects of stress hormones on memory<br />
32. The word &ldquo;shun&rdquo; (Line 1, Para. 1) most probably means _____.<br />
A. cut down on&nbsp;B. stay away from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. run out of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. put up with<br />
33. We can conclude from the study of the 158 nurses in 2001 that _____.<br />
A. people under stress tend to have a poor memory<br />
B. people who can&rsquo;t get their job done experience more stress<br />
C. doing challenging work may be good for one&rsquo;s health <br />
D. stress will weaken the body&rsquo;s defense against germs&nbsp; <br />
34. In the experiment described in Paragraph 3,the video-watchers experienced a downturn in the antibody because _____.<br />
A. the video was not enjoyable at all<br />
B. the outcome was beyond their control<br />
C. they knew little about surgical procedures <br />
D. they felt no pressure while watching the video&nbsp; <br />
35. Which of the following is Dr. Bruce McEwen inclined to emphasize by saying &ldquo;But in the long run these hormones can have a harmful effect on the body and brain&rdquo;? <br />
A. a person&rsquo;s memory is determined by the level of hormones in his body.<br />
B. stress hormones have lasting positive effects on the brain.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
C. short bursts of stress hormones enhance memory function.<br />
D. a person&rsquo;s memory improves with continued experience of stress. <br />
36. What does the author imply to the readers according to the passage?<br />
A. People should avoid stress just as they shun food, love or exercise.<br />
B. People should keep sustained stress which is good for our health.<br />
C. People should live without stress at all.<br />
D. People should not afraid of occasional stress which can be good for us.</p>
<p>Passage Two<br />
He has been at the helm (IB) of the Securities and Exchange Commission for only three months, but William Donaldson has given individual investors reason to believe that he will prove to be an effective champion of their interests as a vigilant regulator of the nation&rsquo;s financial mar&not;kets. The challenges ahead remain daunting, but Mr. Donaldson is steadily restoring the agency&rsquo;s credibility in the wake of its disastrous stewardship by Harvey Pitt.<br />
The SEC. chairman passed his first .big test by persuading William McDonough, the respected president of the New York Federal Reserve, to run the new accounting oversight board created by Congress last summer. He has also opened an important inquiry into trading practices at the New York Stock Exchange. The commission has issued rules to tighten corporate boards&rsquo; oversight over financial audits. Mr. Donaldson should now see that more is done to shore up shareholder democracy.<br />
A reassuring sign that there is a new sheriff(治安官)on Wall Street came in the aftermath of the recently announced landmark settlement with 10 brokerage(经纪人业务)firms over their tainted stock research. The SEC. chairman sternly rebuked Philip Purcell, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, for trying to minimize the extent of his firm&rsquo;s involvement in the scandals. Mr. Donaldson, a former Wall Street banker himself, wrote a letter to Mr. Purcell describing concern over his &ldquo;troubling lack of contrition&rdquo;, and reminding him that Morgan could face further legal problems if it denied the settled charges.<br />
Besides being unusual, Mr. Donaldson&rsquo;s move was a powerful use of his office&rsquo;s bully pulpit (讲坛). With all the talk about whether the SEC. has enough material resources to pursue corporate malfeasance---the agency&rsquo;s budget is being increased significantly---it was easy in the Harvey Pitt era to forget that a strong SEC chairman can wield a great deal of moral authority. This is especially true given financial institutions absolute need to retain public trust.<br />
Mr. Donaldson should be ready to use his bully pulpit often. Wall Street is awash in a &ldquo;troubling lack of contrition&rdquo; for its past misdeeds.<br />
37. From the first sentence of paragraph one we can see that _____<br />
A. Mr. William Donaldson is a very capable chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission<br />
B. the Commission is on a boat<br />
C. Mr. William Donaldson is a steward of a sailing boat<br />
D. Mr. William Donaldson was once a sailing champion<br />
38. From the first paragraph we can infer that Mr. William Donaldson is _____.<br />
A. inexperienced as a steward<br />
B. capable, alert and reliable<br />
C. not much better than Harry Pitt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. following the steps of Harry Pitt<br />
39. In line 6 paragraph 2, what does &ldquo;shore up&rdquo; possibly mean?<br />
A. strengthen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. lighten&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. go to the upside of the shore&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. reduce<br />
40. From paragraph two we can see that _____.<br />
A. Mr. William Donaldson asked Mr. William McDonough to take the exam instead of himself <br />
B. Mr. William McDonough was asked to do what the Congress wanted him to <br />
C. what Mr. William Donaldson has done might violate shareholder democracy <br />
D. Mr. William Donaldson has somewhat exceeded his authority<br />
41. Which of the following statements agrees with the facts appear in the passage?<br />

B. Being the SEC chairman, Mr. William Donaldson is somewhat warlike.<br />
C. Mr. William Donaldson goes to the church regularly. <br />
D. Mr. William Donaldson has done all he can to rebuild the credibility of the SEC.<br />
42. Which of the following will you choose as the title of the passage?<br />
A. New Sheriff of Wall Street.&nbsp;B. A Careerist.<br />
C. A Former Banker Gets on in Life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. A Man Who Knows No Fear.</p>
<p>Passage Three<br />
There is no question that raising teenagers is a challenge no matter how many parents are living in the home. Particularly challenging are the ages between 12 and 16, which are marked by mood swings, defiant attitudes, and attempts to push the limits set by their parents. During this time, teens are trying their hardest to gain adult independence, which is a normal part of the natural growing process.<br />
So, we accept this as a time to help them learn lessons and find their way to adulthood, de&not;spite the fact that it sometimes makes us feel like we are raising aliens from another planet! Two parents in the household can be a definite plus during these years, especially if both are healthy and loving. In single parent homes, a healthy and loving atmosphere is also a key ingredient to raising responsible teens. Also, teens are often masters at pitting (使人相斗) their parents against one another, so when they have divorced parents living in different households, it can be extra difficult to co-parent with effectiveness.<br />
What can single parents do to make the teens in their homes more pleasant? The suggestion is to create realistic and enforceable boundaries. Let your kids know that you will negotiate boundaries every six months, for instance. Let them come up with ideas so that they will be more apt to comply. The topics to discuss may be such as how they spend their time after school, how they spend time with their friends and how should be their dress code and their hairstyles, and so on.<br />
However, when it comes to alcohol, drugs, smoking and other obvious health risks, there should be no negotiation at all. I never give them permission to drink&mdash;and that was final. Let them know they are responsible for their own behavior and should take themselves out of situa&not;tions that could lead to trouble.<br />
A week before your six-month meeting with your teen, call the other parent and talk about how things have been going in each household. Most of the time, there is a wide range of healthy variations in parenting styles. Explain to your teens that when they enter the workforce, they will work with different supervisors, so operating under different household guidelines should be respected and will be good training for their future.<br />
43. The first paragraph tells us that _____.<br />
A. it is necessary for the parents to bring the teenagers to a doctor if they have an unsteady mood <br />
B. raising children from 12 to 16 is an especially difficult task for parents as a whole <br />
C. it is not normal for teenagers to try to gain adult independence <br />
D. in raising children, the more adults there are in a family, the better<br />
44. In the second paragraph, the author implies that _____.<br />
A. on their way to adulthood, some children just behave like foreigners<br />
B. only in single parent homes, a healthy and loving air is a very important factor in raising teens<br />
C. raising teenagers is a difficult task especially in a single parent family<br />
D. many parents divorced as a result of their children&rsquo;s pitting<br />
45. What is the best way to make the teens more pleasant?<br />
A. To distinguish the responsibilities of the parents from those of the children.<br />
B. To be more tolerant to them. <br />
C. To establish the highest mark children can get.<br />
D. To discuss with them the rules of behavior they have to comply.<br />
46. By using the sentence &ldquo;that is final&rdquo;, the author _____<br />
A. shows his firm standpoint on these matters<br />
B. implies that there was to be a sports meet.<br />
C. shows that it is the last time for them to discuss this matter<br />
D. shows that he likes to use sports terms&nbsp; <br />
47. Which of the following statement is NOT TURE? <br />
A. A week before the six-month meeting with the teen, negotiate with your ex-husband or ex-wife.<br />
B. Explain to your teen that he or she should respect different guidelines in different households.<br />
C. In single families the teen actually enjoys the same rights as ones in other family.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
D. The dress code and hairstyles of the teens should be no negotiation at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
48. What is the main idea of the passage?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.

<p>Passage Four<br />
She was slim and he liked her that way. So he called a lawyer. The result was a contract. According to the document, the fresh-faced bride agreed to pay a fine for each pound she gained in weight, the money refundable upon its loss. The paper signed, and the wedding went on.<br />
This is a prenuptial (婚前的) agreement&mdash;one more indication of the strange pass of marriage in this most transactional decade. You are welcome to marriage, contractual style, where increasingly detailed legal documents spell out everything from who&rsquo;s going to do the di&not;shes to who&rsquo;s going to get the house when you split.<br />
This is family planning taken to extreme. Once employed solely by the rich, second-timers and the old industrialist carrying off the latest young cookie, the prenuptial agreement&mdash;a written pact between a couple outlining the financial obligations in the event of divorce&mdash;is becoming commonplace in a litigious (爱打官司的) Disillusioned and materialistic age in which one in ev&not;ery two marriages is projected to end in divorce.<br />
The only question is: What about love? When asked whether anyone believes in Cupid (爱神)anymore, Dr. Michael Vincent Miller says,&rdquo; Given a century that is full of sexual liberation, computer-dating services and so on, one feels tempted to reply, &lsquo;only in a mood of desperate nostalgia(怀旧)&rsquo;.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pre-nups&rdquo; (prenuptial agreements) do assume negativity. Founded on disillusionment, they cannot be separated from the high divorce rate in the United States. The result, argues Miller, is a kind of defending mentality. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gotten good at managing finiteness, fail&not;ure and trouble with a sort of &lsquo;What&rsquo; s yours is yours and what&rsquo;s mine is mine&rsquo;s realism&rsquo;. We&rsquo;ve seen it isn&rsquo;t all about love. We&rsquo;ve seen there&rsquo;s power politics in there&mdash;a fight for control, and when you&rsquo;ve got those things, you&rsquo;re halfway to lawyers and money.&rdquo;<br />
In other ways, however, the compacts embody positive, even idealistic thinking about marriage, love and relations, a law scholar Isabel Marcus believes. Marcus says, &ldquo;Contracts could spell the end of romantic love as salvation. They say love exists, but that it&rsquo;s best accompanied by good, hard thinking about equitability(平等) .&rdquo;<br />
By writing a contract, the couple gains control of its marriage. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s good is it contrib&not;utes to honesty; what&rsquo;s unfortunate is the idea that any contract can govern your emotions,&rdquo; says the author of the book &ldquo;The Nature of Love.&rdquo; <br />

<p>Passage Five<br />
International ocean shipping constitutes a highly significant aspect of world economic and political relationships. The rapid growth in world trade and the emergence of new national enti&not;ties in the last 30 years have further emphasized the role of international shipping. Because of the generally free environment in which it has operated, the industry is highly mobile and flexible--- characteristics that, together with technological progress, have facilitated the rapid growth in world trade.<br />
&nbsp;In recent years, however, there have been several technological and institutional develop&not;ments that are likely to have major efforts on the industry. One of the latter is the aggregation of conventions and practices known as the Law of the Sea, which has been discussed in the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea since 1958. The third UNCLOS began in 1974 and concluded when a treaty was issued on April 30, 1982. The treaty will enter in force when 60 na&not;tions have ratified it. How soon that will happen is, of course, not possible to say. What can be said is that a new legal structure governing the oceans appears to be evolving, with traditional principles giving way to new concepts. Since the environment in which an industry operates de&not;termines its structure and mode of operations, international shipping has been molded by the con&not;ventional principles governing the use of the oceans as highways and will be affected by shifts in the international climate and changes in the Law of Sea.<br />
Ocean shipping, as we know it today, has developed under the concepts of &ldquo;freedom of the seas&rdquo; and limited territorial waters with the rights of &ldquo;innocent passage.&rdquo; Clearly, a new Law of the Sea derived from a reinterpretation of these concepts will significantly change the atmosphere in which the shipping industry operates and, accordingly, dictate revised policies and practices for both industry and public authorities. Minimally, ship operations must consider changes in the definitions of what constitutes the high seas. They must consider the corresponding changes in the jurisdiction of shipping lanes and coastal and open waters compliance with rules for environ&not;mental protection; and vessel traffic controls in some areas.&nbsp; <br />
55. According to the author, international ocean shipping _____. <br />
A. consists of a lot of different aspects <br />
B. has been playing indispensable role in the world trade <br />
C. has generally its own free specific business environment<br />
D. has been playing an ever more significant role in the growth of world trade<br />
56. Conference on the Law of the Sea is hosted by _____.<br />
A. the United Nations&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. the World Bank&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
C. the European Committee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. the World Trade Organization&nbsp; <br />
57. The 1982 treaty on Law of Sea will enter into force _____.<br />
A. on April 30, 1982 <br />
B. in no time<br />
C. after a certain number of countries have joined in it<br />
D. when it has been accepted by most countries in the world&nbsp; <br />
58. The author believes that _____.&nbsp; <br />
A. the conventional principles emphasize the climate of the oceans <br />
B. the conventional principles determine the structure of international shipping in the future<br />
C. the conventional principles will be replaced by the new ones <br />
D. the conventional principles are out of date now <br />
59. According to the author, which of the following is the main reason that leads to the change of principles?<br />
A. countries involved&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. climate shift<br />
C. changes in the Law of Sea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. industrial environment<br />
60. The most proper title for this passage is _____. <br />
A. The Changing Industry of International Shipping <br />
B. The New Law of the Sea <br />
C. International Shipping In Thirty Years <br />
D. New Principles Governing International Shipping</p>

Part I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Translation (30 minutes, 20 points, 10 for each section)<br />
Section A<br />
Directions: Translate the following underlined sentences into Chinese. Write your transla&not;tion on the ANSWER SHEET.<br />
Water problems in the future will become more intense and more complex. Our increasing population will tremendously increase urban wastes, primarily sewage. (l)On the other hand, increasing demands for water will decrease substantially the amount of water available for diluting wastes. (2)Rapidly expanding industries which involve more and more complex chemical processes will produce larger volumes of liquid wastes, and many of these will contain chemicals which are noxious. To feed our rapidly expanding population, agriculture will have to be intensified. This will involve ever-increasing quantities of agricultural chemicals.<br />
(3)From this, it is apparent that drastic steps must be taken immediately to develop correc&not;tive measures for the pollution problem.<br />
There are two ways by which the pollution problem can be dwindled. (4)The first relates to the treatment of wastes to decrease their pollution hazard. This involves the processing of solid wastes &ldquo;prior to&rdquo; disposal and the treatment of liquid wastes, or effluents, to permit the reuse of the water or minimize pollution upon final disposal.<br />
A second approach is to develop an economic use for all or a part of the wastes. (5)Farm manure is spread in fields as a nutrient or organic supplement. Effluents from sewage disposal plants are used in some areas both for irrigation and for the nutrients contained.</p>
