<p>Part III&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading Comprehension (45 minutes, 30 points, 1 for each)<br />
Directions: There are 5 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are 4 choices marked A, B, C and D. Choose the best one and mark the corresponding letter with a single bar across the square brackets on your machine scoring ANSWER SHEET.<br />
Passage One<br />
For more than thirty years after astronauts first set foot on the Moon, scientists have been unable to unravel the mystery of where the Earth&rsquo;s only satellite came from. But now there is direct evidence that the Moon was born after a giant collision between the young Earth and another planet.<br />
Previous studies of rocks from the Earth and the Moon have been unable to distinguish between the two, suggesting that they formed from the same material. But this still left room for a number of theories explaining how---for example, that the Moon and Earth formed from the same material at the same time. It was even suggested that the early Earth spun so fast it formed a bulge that eventually broke off to form the Moon.<br />
Franck Poitrasson, and his colleagues at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology have compared Moon rocks with rocks from Earth and discovered a surprising difference. They analyzed the weight of the elements present in the rock using a highly accurate form of mass spectroscopy(光谱研究) that involves vaporizing a sample by passing it through an argon (氩) flame. Although they appeared very similar in most respects, the Moon rocks had a higher ratio of iron-57 to iron-54 isotopes(同位素)than the Earth rocks. &ldquo;The only way we could explain this difference is that the Moon and the Earth were partly vaporized during their formation,菜&rdquo;says Poitrasson.<br />
Only the popular &ldquo;giant planetary impact&rdquo; theory could generate the temperatures of more than 1 700&deg;C needed to vaporize iron. In this scenario, a Mars-sized planet known as Theia crashed into Earth 50 million years after the birth of the Solar System. This catastrophic collision would have released 100 million times more energy than the impact believed to have wiped out the dinosaurs&mdash;enough to melt and vaporize a large portion of the Earth and completely destroy Theia. The debris from the collision would have been thrown into orbit around the Earth and eventually coalesced to form the Moon.<br />
When iron is vaporized, the lighter isotopes burn off first. And since the ejected debris that became the Moon would have been more thoroughly vaporized, it would have lost a greater proortion of its lighter iron isotopes than Earth did. This would explain the different ratios that Poitrasson has found.<br />
31. The main theme of the passage is _____.<br />
A. the differences between the Earth and the Moon <br />
B. how man manages to set foot onto the Moon <br />
C. the collision between the Earth and the Moon <br />
D. the origin of the Moon<br />
32. Previous studies could not distinguish between _____.<br />
A. the rocks from the Earth and the Moon<br />
B. the Earth and the Moon<br />
C. the Moon and the man-made satellites<br />
D. the young Earth and other planets<br />
33. Franck Poitrasson and his colleagues analyzed the weight of the elements present in the rock in order to ______. <br />
A. find out which rock contains more iron <br />
B. see how hot it needs to vaporize irons <br />
C. investigate how the Moon was formed <br />
D. estimate which rock is more valuable<br />
34. The passage tells us that the Theia crashed into the Earth_____.<br />
A. 100 million years ago<br />
B. leading to the rapid reproduction of the dinosaurs <br />
C. vaporizing the iron on the Earth <br />
D. producing enough energy to split the Earth into halves<br />
35. Which of the following statement is NOT TRUE according to the passage?<br />
A. The Moon was born after a giant collision between the young Earth and another planet. <br />
B. The Moon rocks had a higher ratio of iron 57 to iron 54 isotopes than the Earth rocks. <br />
C. The Moon and the Earth have almost the same portion of iron.<br />
D. This catastrophic collision would have released much more energy than the impact believed to have wiped out the dinosaurs.<br />
36. What can we infer from the passage?<br />
A. There are more lighter iron isotopes on the Moon than on the Earth.<br />
B. There are fewer lighter iron isotopes on the Moon than on the Earth.<br />
C. The Earth had been more thoroughly vaporized than the Moon.<br />
D. Lighter iron isotopes and heavier iron isotopes have the same vaporizing point.<br />
Passage Two<br />
Our brains could be hard-wired to be male or female long before we begin to grow testes(睾丸) or ovaries (卵巢)in the womb. This discovery might explain why some people feel trapped in a body that&rsquo;s the wrong sex, and could also lead to tests that reveal the true &ldquo;brain sex&rdquo; of babies born with ambiguous genitalia(生殖器).<br />
Till now, the orthodoxy among developmental biologists has been that embryos develop ovaries and become female unless a gene called SRY on the Y chromosome is switched on. If this gene is active, it makes testes develop instead. This switch is seen as the key event in determining whether a baby is a girl or a boy. Only after the gonads(性腺) form and flood the body with the appropriate hormones, the theory goes, is the sex of our minds and bodies determined.<br />
But in a study of mice, a team at the University of California, Los Angeles, has now found that males and females show differences in the expression of no fewer than 50 genes well before SRY switches on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first discovery of genes differentially expressed in the brain,&rdquo; says Eric Vilain, who led the UCLA team. &ldquo;They may have an impact on the hard-wired development of the brain in terms of sexual differentiation independent of gonadal induction.&rdquo;<br />
Vilain is presenting details of seven of the 50 genes to the annual meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics in Baltimore this week. Three of these genes are dominant in females and four are dominant in males. The next step for Vilain and his team will be to show that the genes in question really do influence brain sexuality&mdash;and not just in mice. This is likely to be a much tougher proposition than merely showing there are differences in expression.<br />
But if the findings are confirmed, they could one day yield blood tests that allow doctors to establish the brain sex of babies born with genitalia that share features of both sexes. At present, doctors and parents have to guess which gender to assign for surgical &ldquo;correction&rdquo;.<br />
37. The first paragraph tells us that _____.<br />
A. whether we will be male or female is determined by the brain, not the genitalia <br />
B. some people consider themselves to be male but are in fact female physiologically <br />
C. our brain sex is formed long after our testes or ovaries begin to grow <br />
D. some people feel trapped because they have ambiguous genitalia<br />
38. Which of the following word is closer to the word &ldquo;hard-wired&rdquo; in the first paragraph?<br />
A. temporary&nbsp;B. adjustable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. unchangeable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. revisable<br />
39. According to the orthodoxy among developmental biologists, if SRY is active,_____. <br />
A. the baby can either be a boy or a girl <br />
B. the baby will surely be a girl <br />
C. the baby will definitely come to be a boy <br />
D. the baby will certainly develop ambiguous genitalia<br />
40. What has been found by the study at UCLA?<br />
A. We human beings have fewer than fifty genes.<br />
B. Males and females have similar expression genes.<br />
C. Differences in the expression of genes appear before SRY switches on.<br />
D. Sexual differentiation depends mainly on gonadal induction.<br />
41. From paragraph 4 we know that Vilain and his team are going to _____. <br />
A. continue to study the influence of genes on human brain sexuality <br />
B. look for more dominant genes for males as well as for females <br />
C. continue their study about genes on mice <br />
D. show that there are differences in expression of genes of males and females<br />
42. We can infer from the last paragraph that ______.<br />
A. all babies are born with genitalia that share features of both sexes<br />
B. surgical correction operations at present are mainly based on guessing<br />
C. in the future fewer babies will be born with ambiguous genitalia<br />
D. in the future doctors may be able to decide whether a baby is to be a boy or a girl</p>
<p>Passage Three<br />
Scraps of food could soon be helping power your home, thanks to an ultra-cheap bacteria-driven battery. Its developers hope that instead of feeding the dog or making garden compost(混合肥料),organic household waste could top up your home&rsquo;s electricity.<br />
Although such &ldquo;microbial fuel cells&rdquo; (MFCs) have been developed in the past, they have always proved extremely inefficient and expensive. Now Chris Melhuish and technologists at the University of the West of England (UWE) in Bristol have come up with a simplified MFC that costs as little as &pound; 10 to make.<br />
Right now, their fuel cell runs only on sugar cubes, since these produce almost no waste when broken down, but they aim to move on to carrot power. &ldquo;It has to be able to use raw mate&not;rials, rather than giving it a refined fuel,&rdquo; says Melhuish.<br />
Inside the Walkman-sized battery, a colony of E. coli bacteria produce enzymes that break down carbohydrates, releasing hydrogen atoms. The cell also contains chemicals that drive a series of redox, or reduction and oxidation reactions, stripping electrons from the hydrogen atoms and delivering them steadily to the fuel cell&rsquo;s anode (正极).This creates a voltage that can be used to power a circuit.<br />
To prove the MFC works, the researchers are using it to power a small light-sensitive robot. And when a number of the cells are connected in series, they could power domestic appliances, running a 40-watt bulb for eight hours on about 50 grams of sugar. <br />
Earlier MFCs were inefficient because they relied on energy-hungry filters and pumps. By experimenting with different anode materials, the UWE team have figured out how to make their system work: they dump the bacteria and redox chemicals directly into the cell.<br />
In its current form, he UWE team says its organic battery can produce eight times as much power as any previous MFC. But Melhuish wants to improve this, both by scaling it up and finding a better mix of redox chemicals.<br />
43. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage?<br />
A. Microbial fuel cells.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Cost-efficient microbial fuel cells.<br />

<p>Passage Four<br />
Is there enough oil beneath the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to help secure America&rsquo;s energy future? President Bush certainly thinks so. He has argued that tapping ANWR&rsquo;s oil would help ease California&rsquo;s electricity crisis and provide a major boost to the country&rsquo;s energy independence. But no one knows for sure how much crude oil lies buried beneath the frozen earth, with the last government survey, conducted in 1998, projecting output anywhere from 3 billion to 16 billion barrels.<br />
The oil industry goes with the high end of the range, which could equal as much as 10% of U.S. consumption for as long as six years. By pumping more than 1 million barrels a day from the reserve for the next two to three decades, lobbyists claim, the nation could cut back on imports equivalent to all shipments to the U.S. from Saudi Arabia. Sounds good. An oil boom would also mean a multibillion-dollar windfall (意外之财) in tax re venues, royalties (开采权使用费)and leasing fees for Alaska and the Federal Government. Best of all, advocates of drilling say, damage to the environment would be insignificant. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never had a documented case of an oil rig chasing deer out onto the pack ice,&rdquo; says Alaska State Representative Scott Ogan.<br />
Not so fast, say environmentalists. Sticking to the low end of government estimates, the National Resources Defense Council says there may be no more than 3.2 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil in the coastal plain of ANWR, a drop in the bucket that would do virtually nothing to ease America&rsquo;s energy problems. And consumers would wait up to a decade to gain any benefits, because drilling could begin only after much bargaining over leases, environ-mental permits and regulatory review. As for ANWR&rsquo;s impact on the California power crisis, environmentalists point out that oil is responsible for only 1% of the Golden State&rsquo;s electricity output---and just 3% of the nation&rsquo;s.<br />
49. What does President Bush think of tapping oil in ANWR? <br />
A. It will exhaust the nation&rsquo;s oil reserves. <br />
B. It will help secure the future of ANWR. <br />
C. It will help reduce the nation&rsquo;s oil imports. <br />
D. It will increase America&rsquo;s energy consumption.<br />
50. We learn from the second paragraph that the American oil industry _____. <br />
A. believes that drilling for oil in ANWR will produce high yields <br />
B. tends to exaggerate America&rsquo;s reliance on foreign oil <br />
C. shows little interest in tapping oil in ANWR <br />
D. expects to stop oil imports from Saudi Arabia<br />
51. Those against oil drilling in ANWR argue that _____. <br />
A. it can cause serious damage to the environment <br />
B. it can do little to solve U.S. energy problems <br />
C. it will drain the oil reserves in the Alaskan region <br />
D. it will not have much commercial value<br />
52. What do the environmentalists mean by saying &ldquo;Not so fast&rdquo;(Line l, Para. 3)? <br />
A. Tap the oil there more slowly and carefully. <br />
B. Think it over how to protect the environment there.<br />
C. Never expect ANWR to supply enough oil for the country in the near future. <br />
D. Don&rsquo;t expect too optimistic profit and gain.<br />
53. It can be learned from the passage that oil exploitation beneath ANWR&rsquo;s frozen earth<br />
A. remains a controversial issue <br />
B. is expected to get under way soon <br />
C. involves a lot of technological problems <br />
D. will enable the U. S. to be oil independent <br />
54. Which of the following is NOT TURE according to the passage?<br />
A. The government argued that oil industry could go with the high end of the range, that is, 16 billion barrels.<br />
B. The environmentalists stuck to the low end of government estimates---30 billion barrels. <br />
C. Consumers may wait up to a decade to gain benefits from oil drilling. <br />
D. Drilling can disregard for bargaining over leases, environmental permits and regulatory review.</p>
<p>Passage Five<br />
I&rsquo;d been living with my wife for eight years and one night. Morn says, &ldquo;I guess you guys are never going to get married. I mean, you&rsquo;ve been through jail together, you&rsquo;re living together, but. . . , oh, forget it.&rdquo;&nbsp; <br />
&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;put it like that and I&rsquo;ll marry your daughter tomorrow.&rdquo;<br />
Actually, I don&rsquo;t know what we were waiting for, except that for a guy it&rsquo;s never the right time to get married. I&rsquo; m also suspicious of any two people who don&rsquo;t struggle with that deci&not;sion. Part of my problem was that I was still lusting in my heart after other ladies. But somehow I knew that I wasn&rsquo;t going to find another woman remotely as great as my soon-to-be wife. It&rsquo;s a good thing my mother-in-law finally spoke up.<br />
I finally gathered my courage one day when we were having a picnic, and popped the ques&not;tion. I also gave my wife a big tourist pamphlet about Switzerland. I wasn&rsquo;t taking any chances.<br />
She said no.<br />
It killed me. I felt sick to my stomach. I lost my appetite. Our dog just stared at me, thinking, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not going to eat your lunch, I will.&rdquo; Finally, I said, &ldquo;But the Switzerland trip is yours if you say yes.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Switzerland,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is filled with precise, humorless people.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Maybe I should have suggested Paris?&rdquo;<br />
For a minute it seemed as if my change in travel plans would rate a solid &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;. But she said no again. When we woke up the next morning, she told me that she&rsquo;d slept on my proposal. &ldquo;I guess I was a little rude to you last night,&rdquo; she explained. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m figuring I&rsquo;m off the hook for this marriage thing for at least another eight years. I could afford to be generous.<br />
&ldquo;I asked, you said no. It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; I said. I might have looked a little too relieved because later that day she gave me a little box. Inside was a gold watch. On the back was inscribed. &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve reconsidered.&rdquo;<br />
I liked the watch, so I did the right thing.<br />
55. The reason why the man had waited so long for his marriage was that he _____. <br />
A. didn&rsquo;t think eight years was long enough <br />
B. suspected that husband and wife would often quarrel <br />
C. didn&rsquo;t think he was ready to propose to her <br />
D. was waiting for his mother-in-law&rsquo;s approval<br />
56. Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage? <br />
A. The man didn&rsquo;t know what he was waiting for. <br />
B. No couples don&rsquo; t need to struggle with the decision for marriage. <br />
C. The man appreciated it that his mother-in-law brought forward the issue of marriage. <br />
D. He had no lust in other ladies.<br />
57. The man proposed to the woman because _____. <br />
A. he realized he could find no other woman better <br />
B. he was afraid that the woman might leave him <br />
C. he was eager to visit Switzerland with the woman <br />
D. he could finally overcome his fear for marriage<br />
58. By saying &ldquo;I could afford to be generous,&rdquo; (third paragraph from the bottom) the man implied that he _____ <br />
A. wouldn&rsquo;t care too much if he stayed single<br />
B. could take her to a better place than Paris<br />
C. was rich enough to support his wife<br />
D. didn&rsquo;t care what she thought about his proposal<br />
59. The last sentence &ldquo;I did the right thing&rdquo; implied he _____.<br />
A. traveled with his wife&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. had a successful marriage<br />
C. liked the watch very much&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. waited for another eight years<br />
60. The best title for this text would be _____ .<br />
A. How My Mother- In-Law Helped Me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. How I Received a Gold Watch I Liked<br />
C. How I Made My Wife Travel With Me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. How I Came to Marry My Wife</p>

Part I Translation (30 minutes, 20 points, 10 for each section)<br />
Section A<br />
Directions: Translate the following underlined sentences into Chinese. Write your translation on the ANSWER SHEET.<br />
Italy, the land of Dante, declared war on officialese (官样文章) recently, vowing to simplify the way the state communicates with its citizens. (l)&rdquo;This is a cultural revolution in our relationship with citizens,&rdquo; Civil Service Minister Franco Frattini told a news conference to unveil a Project to make bureaucratic language understandable. The project called &ldquo;Chiaro!&rdquo; (Clear!), aims to rid the language used in bureaucratic texts of complex clauses and confusing terms. (2) While Italians were keeping their fingers crossed it would succeed, Frattini acknowledged it would be an uphill struggle. (3) Many existing government texts would be changed into more simple language but the hardest part would be to teach old dogs new tricks. &ldquo;It would be useless to translate the documents and not train personnel to stop using ancient, incomprehensible language, &ldquo;he said. (4) Ministries would be encouraged to compete for a &ldquo;Chiaro !&rdquo; ( Clear ! ) stamp, which could be awarded only to departments and ministries that wrote simply. Professor Alfredo Fioritto, who heads a task of legal experts and linguists, admitted it was going tough. &ldquo;There are hundreds of years of tradition to today the government speaks like it did in the nineteenth century,&rdquo; he said. (5) &ldquo;Simplifying language is very difficult. It means you have to know what you are talking about.&rdquo;<br />
Section B<br />
Directions: Translate the following passage into English. Write your translation on the ANSWER SHEET.<br />
在信用卡时代，货币已变成塑料制品，而实际上现金也正在越来越多的国家变成塑料制品。传统的纸币流通了300多年之后正在逐渐被新的聚合物工艺制造的货币所取代。<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 塑料钞票的优点是相当值得考虑的。它比纸币成本大约高1倍，却有4到5倍的使用寿命---澳大利亚的10澳元纸币平均寿命为8个月，而塑料钞票至少能用30个月。塑料钞票还能使自动取款机的卡纸现象减少38％。<br />
