<p>Part III Reading Comprehension (45 minutes, 30 points, 1 for each)<br />
Directions: There are 5 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are 4 choices marked A, B , C and D. Choose the best one and mark the corresponding letter with a single bar across the square brackets on your machine scoring ANSWER SHEET.<br />
Passage One<br />
The heart bypass (心脏搭桥术)has become part of our cultural life. It has come to seem like a ceremony of passage for the successful male, a red symbol of courage in midlife. Six hundred thousand bypass operations are performed a year in the United States. After a bypass, most heart patients experience significant relief from the peculiar discomfort in the chest caused by insuffi&not;cient blood to the heart muscle. In some cases the surgery can dramatically extend life. Ameri&not;can heart patients, who now number about 12 million, are enthusiastic about the surgery. Bypass is one of the most common major operations in America.<br />
In private, however, many of my fellow workers in medicine suspect that bypass has become too popular. A recent Harvard study showed that as many as two-thirds of patients referred for bypass don&rsquo;t need it or could have it postponed. In Canada and Britain, where physicians perform bypass surgery much less frequently than they do in America, heart patients fare just as well. In addition, bypassing a blocked section of an artery does nothing to prevent the artery (动脉) getting clogged somewhere else. In fact, bypass surgery can accelerate the development of new blockage.<br />
But bypass did not have to prove itself. It has become hugely popular. Voices of caution were drowned out as more and more hospitals raced to offer bypass. By 1979, 100 000 bypasses a year were taking place, and 10 years later the figure has risen to 260, 000. Medical students were keen to train in cardiac (心脏的)surgery; for all the hard training, it was a advancing, challenging field. In fact, the rewards are handsome. There is more money to be made performing this sur&not;gery than there is in practicing in almost any other field of medicine.<br />
The idea of bold surgeons reaching into our bodies to save a wounded heart cannot but exert a powerful grip on our imaginations, as if we are witnessing a cultural ceremony where two over-achieving individuals---surgeon and patient---come together. Bypass may indeed be both a life-extending and pain-relieving procedure for many patients. But perhaps it has transfixed us for too long.<br />
31. According to the passage, a bypass surgery is _____. <br />
A. a dangerous operation <br />
B. a painful experience<br />
C. a symbol of one&rsquo;s success and courage<br />
D. nothing serious&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
32. From the second paragraph, we can see that the author is _____.<br />
A. one of the heart patients&nbsp;B. a boss in pharmacy<br />
C. a teacher in Harvard University&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. a medical worker&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
33. What conclusion can we come to according to the passage?<br />
A. In a sense we may call the United States a &ldquo;bypass nation&rdquo;.<br />
B. In Canada and the U.K. bypass operations are less performed because their medical lev-els are relatively lower.<br />
C. Bypass operations can solve the heart patients&rsquo; problems once and for all.<br />
D. Recent study shows that nearly all of the bypass operations in the United States are proved useless and needless. <br />
34. Bypass operation has become very popular in the United States because _____.<br />
A. it is one of the most common major operations<br />
B. it is more effective than any other medicine<br />
C. the standard of living in America is much higher than that in any other country <br />
D. it can bring more money to the hospitals and doctors<br />
35. In the third paragraph, the word &ldquo;handsome&rdquo; actually mean _____.<br />
A. beautiful&nbsp;B. considerable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. poor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. good-looking<br />
36. In the last paragraph the author implies that _____.<br />
A. the popularity of bypass operation has its profound financial reasons<br />
B. doing bypass operation makes a doctor famous<br />
C. we shouldn&rsquo;t have blind faith in anything even if it is good<br />
D. receiving a bypass operation makes a person satisfied</p>
<p>Passage Two<br />
More American mothers than ever are working, and more workers are mothers. Yet their march into the world of paid work continues to cause suspicion. One recent survey found that 48 percent of Americans believe that preschoolers suffer if their mothers work, while another found that 42 percent of employed parents think that working mothers care more about succeeding at work than meeting their children&rsquo;s needs.<br />
All mothers deserve our support&mdash;those who care for children at home and those who have joined the work force. But many working mothers continue to believe that they are shortchang&not;ing (少找钱)their children. They shouldn&rsquo;t. Research tells us that kids do just fine when moth&not;ers work.<br />
Suzanne Bianchi a scientist of the University of Maryland, has found that mothers today spend as much if not more time with their children than they did in 1965, even though the per&not;centage of mothers who work rose from 35 percent to 71 percent. Then there are the obvious fi&not;nancial benefits. For many children, these earnings are the difference between living in pover&not;ty&mdash;or out of it.<br />
The kids are all right. Studies conducted by the University of Michigan have consistently demonstrated that a child&rsquo;s social or academic competence does not depend on whether a mother is employed. In my research four out of five children (nine out of ten in single parent families) told me that having a working mother was their preferred arrangement. My study found that children with working mothers are no more likely to drop out, take drugs, break the law, or ex&not;periment with sex prematurely than children with non-employed mothers. Children have taken their mothers&rsquo; example to heart. Ninety percent of the young women I interviewed said they hoped to combine work with motherhood, while two-thirds of the men said they wanted to share parenting and work. <br />
Sadly, children support working mothers more than we do as a society. Parental leave and child-care benefits in the United States remain inadequate, particularly when compared to what&rsquo;s offered in other countries. Children thrive when their mothers have satisfying, well-paid jobs when they can count on other caretakers to share the load. The challenge facing us is thus not whether good workers can also be good mothers, but whether we can create the conditions that enable working mothers and fathers to be good parents.<br />
37. From the first paragraph, we can see that _____.<br />
A. now more American mothers are working than any time in American history and any&not;where else in the world<br />
B. more than half Americans think that before going to school, children need their mothers&rsquo; whole-hearted care<br />
C. a majority of Americans believe that once working outside home mothers think of their own work more than their children<br />
D. more American mothers work than ever before, but this problem of working mothers has not been solved satisfactorily<br />
38. In paragraph two, the author thinks that _____.<br />
A. society should support all mothers no matter where they work&mdash;at home or outside it <br />
B. working mothers are doing less for their children <br />
C. we should do more research on this problem <br />
D. working mothers should be proud<br />
39. From the passage, we can not find the proof of the fact that _____. <br />
A. now mothers do their household work just as well as they did before <br />
B. with their mothers working, children are better off <br />
C. lack of mothers&rsquo; care, children like to go astray <br />
D. in single-parent families, most children like their mothers go out working<br />
40. In the last paragraph, &ldquo;Parental leave and child-care benefits in the United States remain inadequate&rdquo; actually refers to _____.<br />
A. parents should not leave and pay more care to their children&nbsp; <br />
B. parental leave and child-care is contradicted&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
C. children have inadequate care from their parents<br />
D. in the United States, parents enjoy inadequate child-care leave and allowance<br />
41. What do the Americans need in solving the problem of working mothers?<br />
A. They need the support of males.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
B. They need the understanding of other members of their families.&nbsp; <br />
C. They need young people to be well-prepared to work both in and outside their homes.<br />
D. They need especially the powerful support of the society for working mothers. <br />
42. What is the main idea of the passage?<br />
A. We should let mothers work without worry. <br />
B. It is better for mothers to stay at home. <br />
C. We should work hard, especially mothers. <br />
D. Like mother, like children.<br />
Passage Three<br />
Laundry is, after all, just laundry. Except when it&rsquo;s not. And Procter &amp; Gamble Co. recently realized that Tide, its segment-dominating cash cow, despite adding three share points in the past year for a total 42% of the category, was in jeopardy of slipping into mere commodity status. That&rsquo;s when consumers buy on price and habit, which can spell the end of brand growth.<br />
The problem: Tide for the past four years had only advertised mundane stain-fighting messa&not;ges. Such creative indifference hardly did justice to an iconic brand so cool that Kevin Roberts, CEO of Tide agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, wrote in his book, Love marks: The Future Beyond Brands: &ldquo;I saw Neil Young in a recording studio wearing a sleeveless T-shirt with a Tide logo, and it just screamed possibilities. &ldquo;<br />
So, in an attempt to cultivate Tide&rsquo;s inner &ldquo;love mark,&rdquo; new ads now dismiss the notion that laundry detergent is a mere commodity. Instead, they reflect P&amp;G&rsquo;s conviction that the &ldquo;rela&not;tionship&rdquo; women&mdash;they&rsquo;re not bothering with men&mdash;have with their laundry goes well beyond cleaning grass-stained T-shirts.<br />
Indeed, the effort is part of a company wide strategy to reestablish bonds between customers and all of its brands, no matter how mature or mundane Lynne Boyles, P&amp;G global vice-president for advertising, says the company is on a mission to unearth and cultivate the deep connections people have with its products.<br />
&ldquo;We are striving for that with all of our brands.&rdquo;<br />
The P&amp;G team concluded that it needed more than Marketing 101 ads. One TV commercial depicts a pregnant woman spilling ice cream on the last shirt that fits. Another shows a mother in white pants rushing from her office today care and then with her daughter to a park. The mes&not;sage: Tide lets women focus on the important things. The new slogan says little about cleaning. Instead,&rdquo; Tide knows fabric best&rdquo; is meant to encompass the broader range of Tide products on the shelf today.<br />
The Tide ads reflect the mandate of P&amp;G marketing chief James Stengel that brands must<br />
speak to consumers eye-to-eye rather than relentlessly driving product benefits. Behind the<br />
strategy lies the cold truth that product benefits are quickly copied, whether it&rsquo;s cleaning power<br />
or diaper absorbency. So P&amp;G is putting more capital into how a consumer feels toward a<br />
brand,a value harder to replicate. As the market leader, P&amp;G&rsquo;s best course is to &ldquo;stake out the<br />
emotional high ground,&rdquo; says Graham Woodall, executive creative director at ad agency JWT<br />
Worldwide.<br />
43. Despite a total 42% of the category, Tide recently _____ <br />

44. Kevin Roberts acknowledges that _____.<br />

Passage Four<br />
If someone just studies a few recent corporate recruitment advertisements, there will be at least one thing he or she will find common in almost all of them. The recruiters are putting much emphasis on hiring a one-team man rather than a one-man team, in the management category at least.<br />
In accordance to this shift, the office atmosphere is changing too. CEOs of the companies at present are accessible to general employees more than ever before. The visual distance is cut short. Office decorations are changing with more and more interlinked and free sitting arrangements. At this age, one can never ignore the psychological affect on human beings created by the respective surroundings.<br />
The corporate houses these days are spending huge amounts to unite the workforce into an active team. Active and spontaneous participation of employees in both internal and external af&not;fairs of the company and even in the decision making process are regarded as the path of pro&not;gress,.<br />
The main problem in the corporate team building process namely &lsquo; distancing&rsquo; is predomi&not;nantly inherent in employees&rsquo; as well as in the employer&rsquo;s psyche. It is one of the basic instincts of human beings.<br />
The primary team building process is constantly fighting to throw away &lsquo;distancing&rsquo; to a great distance. The ideal corporate team building events concentrate on bringing together employees who do not always get the chance to come in close, if not in personal contact with each other.<br />
The prime ideological stand is that, if an employee does not know his or her co-workers then he or she cannot actively participate to boost up the company profile and morale as a whole. It is all about fixing the SELF, not into the category called OTHER, but under the umbrella named WE. <br />
The corporate event management companies divide the employees into various groups. Apparently, it seems that the process is breaking the basic notion of team building activities, but in fact, it just adds to the notion.<br />
The participants here never feel rivalry among themselves. They are conscious that it is merely a game though they need to win. Thus, they fail to concentrate on the issue that it is a part of the team building exercise tailored by the company. This lack of concentration on the subtle issue ultimately does the trick. The idea of the team is built in the consciousness of the participant that excludes the visual divisions.<br />
49. The difference between one team man and one man team lies in ______. <br />
A. team members&rsquo; initiatives<br />
B. an individual&rsquo;s ability <br />
C. team members&rsquo; relationship with leaders<br />
D. communication and interaction among team members<br />
50. What is the purpose of cutting short visual distance between CEOs and his/her employees?<br />
A. To remove the sense of mystery of the former.<br />
B. To make room for relaxation to both.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
C. To create an intimate working atmosphere.<br />
D. To make inspection more convenient.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
51. What may be regarded as the bottleneck for the corporate team building process?<br />
A. Distancing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Inequality&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Initiatives&nbsp;D. Office atmosphere<br />
52. What is NOT a typical team-building event?&nbsp; <br />
A.&nbsp;A meeting that all corporate employees participate in<br />
B.&nbsp;A brainstorming activity.<br />
C.&nbsp;A group discussion with people having personal contacts <br />
D.&nbsp;A conference aims at cutting distance among employees. <br />
53. &ldquo;Fixing the self&rdquo; in the 6th paragraph probably means _____.<br />
A.&nbsp;staying firm on same position<br />
B.&nbsp;identifying one&rsquo;s role in a team <br />
C.&nbsp;standing out in performing important task<br />
D.&nbsp;excluding others from a team<br />
54. The participants never feel rivalry among themselves simply because _____.<br />
A.&nbsp;they are open-minded and willing to help others <br />
B.&nbsp;they want to establish a close relationship with other participants<br />
C.&nbsp;they feel as if they were playing a virtual game but actually not<br />
D.&nbsp;they don&rsquo;t mind losing the game</p>
<p>Passage Five<br />
Anyone who&rsquo;s ever taken a preschooler to the doctor knows they often cry more before the shot than afterward. Now researchers using brain scans to unravel the biology of dread have an explanation: For some people, anticipating pain is truly as bad as experiencing it. <br />
How bad? Among people who volunteered to receive electric shocks, almost a third opted for a stronger zap if they could just get it over with, instead of having to wait. More importantly, the research found that how much attention the brain pays to expected pain determines whether someone is an &ldquo;extreme dreader&rdquo;---suggesting that simple diversions could alleviate the misery.<br />
The research, published in the journal Science, is part of a burgeoning new field called neu-ro-economics that uses brain imaging to try to understand how people make choices. Until now, most of that work has focused on reward, the things people will do for positive outcomes.<br />
&ldquo;We were interested in the dark side of the equation,&rdquo; explained Dr. Gregory Berns of Em&not;ory University, who led the new study. &ldquo;Dread often makes us make bad decisions.&rdquo; Standard economic theory says that people should postpone bad outcomes for as long as possible, because something might happen in the interim to improve the outlook.<br />
In real life the &ldquo;just get it over with&rdquo; reaction is more likely, said Berns, a professor of psy-chiatry and behavioral sciences. He offers a personal example: he usually pays credit card bills as soon as they arrive instead of waiting until they&rsquo;re due, even though &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense economically.&rdquo; So Berns designed a study to trace dread inside the brain. He put 32 volunteers into an MRI machine while giving them a series of 96 electric shocks to the foot. The shocks varied in intensity, from barely detectable to the pain of a needle jab.<br />
Participants were told one was coming, how strong it would be, and how long the wait for it would be, from 1 to 27 seconds. Later, participants were given choices: Would they prefer a medium jolt in 5 seconds or 27 seconds? What about a mild jolt in 20 seconds vs. a sharp one in 3 seconds? When the voltage was identical, the volunteers almost always chose the shortest wait. But those Berns dubbed &ldquo;extreme dreaders&rdquo; picked the worst shock if it meant not having to wait as long.<br />
The MRI scans showed that a brain network that governs how much pain people feel became active even before they were shocked, particularly the parts of this &ldquo;pain matrix&rdquo; that are linked to attention&mdash;but not brain regions involving fear and anxiety. The more dread bothered some&not;one, the more attention the pain-sensing parts of the brain were paying to the wait.<br />
In other words, the mere information that you&rsquo;re about to feel pain &ldquo;seems to be a source of misery,&rdquo; George Lowenstein, a specialist in economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon Uni&not;versity, wrote in an accompanying review of the work. &ldquo;These findings support the idea that the decision to delay or expedite an outcome depends critically on how a person feels while waiting,&rdquo; Lowenstein added.<br />
The National Institute on Drug Abuse funded the research. What&rsquo;s the link between dread and drug use? It&rsquo;s indirect, but now that scientists know how healthy people&rsquo;s brains anticipate unpleasant consequences, future studies can compare how drug abusers process such informa&not;tion .<br />
55. By giving the example of a preschooler, the author wants to show that _____.<br />
A. children are afraid of being shot by doctor<br />
B. waiting is a painful process<br />
C. we should give a shot to a child as slow as possible<br />
D. bodily pain is less important<br />

A. standard economical theory has proved its correctness <br />
B. bad outcomes should come later<br />
C. It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense economically<br />
D. people take immediate action lest bad outcome should occur in future&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
57. Which of the following statements about &ldquo;extreme dreaders&rdquo; is TRUE?<br />
A. They can tolerate waiting for pain as long as possible<br />
B. They don&rsquo;t want to end the experience of electric shock as quick as possible<br />
C. They want to get the electric shock as quick as possible even though it can badly hurt<br />
D. They are extremely afraid of experiencing pain<br />
58. People choose to receive worst electric shock in comparatively shorter time because <br />
A. the parts of the &ldquo;pain matrix&rdquo; that are linked to attention <br />
B. brain regions involving fear and anxiety link to attention <br />
C. they want their attention be stimulated <br />
D. The more fear disturbed someone, the more attention the pain-sensing parts of the brain<br />
were paying to the wait&nbsp; <br />
59. According to George Lowenstein for a dreadful outcome <br />
A. people should let it comes as quick as possible <br />
B. people should prevent it from happening <br />
C. people should adjust their feeling while waiting <br />
D. people should feel optimistic<br />

Dalton wondered why the heavier and lighter gases in the atmosphere did not separate as oil and water do. He finally concluded that the constituent 61 must exist in the form of tiny particles or atoms and that these 62 be completely mixed together in the atmosphere. This threw a new light in 63 law of definite proportions. It was only necessary to suppose that the atoms 64 combine into small groups of uniform 65 and so form more complex substance;&nbsp; 66&nbsp; the mystery of this law was 67 Dalton suggested, for example, that carbon monoxide 68 formed by the one with one 69 of atoms of carbon and oxygen, 70 carbon dioxide results from a single 71 of carbon uniting with two, atoms of oxy&not;gen. Assuming this to be true, 72&nbsp; the definite proportions of Prout&rsquo;s law 73 all chemical compounds the different constituents 74 enter in unvarying proportions would naturally 75 the relative weights of the many different kinds of atoms.<br />

Part I Translation (30 minutes, 20 points, 10 for each section)<br />
Section A<br />
Directions: Translate the following passage into Chinese. Write your translation on the ANSWER SHEET. <br />
In an on-demand world, the ability to sense and respond to change in customer needs will be more important than size. Since change will be unpredictable, flexibility will be of the utmost importance. Fixed costs will reduce your flexibility ---variable costs will increase it.<br />
The new business model will require a corresponding on-demand operating environment--- built on open standards to allow quick, easy and cost-effective innovation and reconfiguration.<br />
In the on-demand era, processes will have to be integrated from one end to the other---so a customer order, for example, creates a ripple effect in which every part of the organization responds appropriately to the impact of the order: logistics, manufacturing and distribution. The level of integration needed to make this happen is a big challenge but a huge opportunity.<br />
In this era, you&rsquo;ll need an e-business partner you can trust, e-business tools that work in new ways and e-business people who understand your business as well as the technology it runs on.<br />
A partner, in other words, like IBM.</p>
