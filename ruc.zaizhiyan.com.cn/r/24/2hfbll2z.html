<p>Part III&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading Comprehension (45 minutes, 30 points, 1 for each)<br />
Directions: There are 5 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are 4 choices marked A, B, C and D. Choose the best one and mark the corresponding letter with a single bar across the square brackets on your machine scoring ANSWER SHEET.<br />
Passage One<br />
A few years ago, when environmentalists in Washington State began agitating to rid local dumps of toxic old computers and televisions, they found an unexpected ally: Hewlett-Packard Co. Teaming up with greens and retailers, hp took on IBM, Apple Computer, and several major TV manufacturers, which were resisting recycling programs because of the costs.<br />
Aided by hp's energetic lobbying, the greens persuaded state lawmakers to adopt a landmark program that forces electronics companies to foot the bill for recycling their old equipment. &quot;This bill puts our market-based economy to work for the environment,&quot; said Washington Gov&not;ernor Christine O. Gregoire as she signed the plan into law on Mar 24. The movement to recycle electronic refuse, or &quot;e-waste,&quot; is spreading across the nation, and so is hp's clout. The company helped the greens win a big battle in Maine.<br />
In 2004 when the state passed the nation's first e-waste &quot;take-back&quot; law. Washington fol&not;lowed suit. Now, Minnesota and New Jersey are preparing to act, and 19 other states are weig&not;hing legislation. Activists hope to banish high-tech junk from landfills and scrub the nation's air and water of lead, chromium, mercury, and other toxins prevalent in digital debris, hp's efforts have made it the darling of environmentalists. They say take-back laws are more effective at getting digital junk recycled than point-of-sale fees, which tax consumer electronics products to fund state-run recycling programs. They're also pleased because effective programs in the U.S. reduce the likelihood that the products will be shipped to less developed countries and disassem&not;bled under unsafe conditions.<br />
But hp's agenda isn't entirely altruistic. Take-back laws play to the company's strategic strengths. For decades the computer maker has invested in recycling infrastructure, a move that has lowered its production costs, given it a leg up in the secondary market for equipment, and al&not;lowed it to build a customer service out of &quot;asset management,&quot; which includes protection of da&not;ta that might remain on discarded gear.<br />
In 2005, hp recycled more than 70 000 tons of product, the equivalent of about 10% of com&not;pany sales and a 15% increase from the year before. And it collected more than 2.5 million units (in excess of 25 000 tons) of hardware to be refurbished for resale or donation.<br />
No other electronics maker has a resale business on this scale. But the others may soon wish to emulate hp. &quot;We see legislation coming,&quot; says David Lear, hp's vice-president for corporate, social, and environmental responsibility. &quot;A lot of companies haven't stepped up to the plate.... If we do this right, it becomes an advantage to us.&quot;<br />
31. Environmentalists found an unexpected ally because _____.<br />
A. hp has jointed with greens and retailers to rid local dumps<br />
B. hp doesn't mind the huge cost of recycling old computers<br />
C. hp has green retailers<br />
D. IBM, Apple Computer don't want to cooperate with greens and retailers<br />
32. Washington Governor Christine O. Gregoire signed the plan that _____<br />
&nbsp;A. was proposed by hp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
B. requires electronic companies pay for recycling their equipment <br />
C. can boost market-based economy&nbsp; <br />
D. helped spread hp's clout&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
33. Which state first passed the take-back law?<br />
A. Maine.&nbsp;B. Washington.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Minnesota.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. New Jersey.<br />
34. Which of the following statements about the e-waste take back laws is NOT true? <br />
A. It won support from both environmentalists and hp. <br />
B. It recommends recycling instead of burying hi-tech waste.<br />
C. It may cut recycling costs to manufactures compared to collection of point-of-sale fees. <br />
D. It may directly threat the livelihood of people in less developed countries relying on dis&not;sembling wastes.<br />
35. Why does the author say hp's agenda is not altruistic?<br />
I. Because recycling infrastructure is a major sources of revenue.<br />
II. Because secondary market is huge.<br />
III. Because it can win respect of users and environmentalists.<br />
IV. Because asset management of used computers can add revenue to the company.<br />
A. I&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp; II&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. II and III&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. II and IV<br />
36. hp collected more than 2.5 million hardware units in order to _____.<br />
A. renew them for resale or donation<br />
B. dissemble them for making cheap products<br />
C. built a large data base<br />
D. repair them before giving them to charity organizations<br />
Passage Two<br />
On an average of six times a day, a doctor in Holland practices &quot;active&quot; euthanasia (安乐死) Intentionally administering a lethal (致死的)drug to a terminally ill patient who has asked to be relieved of suffering. Twenty times a day, life-prolonging treatment is withheld or withdrawn when there is no hope that it can effect an ultimate cure. &quot;Active&quot; euthanasia remains a crime on the Dutch statute books, punishable by 12 years in prison. But a series of court cases over the past 15 years has made it clear that a competent physician who carries it out will not be prosecuted. <br />
Euthanasia, often called &quot;mercy killing&quot; is a crime everywhere in Western Europe. But more and more doctors and nurses readily admit to practicing it, most often in the &quot;passive&quot; form of withholding or withdrawing treatment. The long simmering euthanasia issue has lately boiled over into a, sometimes, fierce public debate, with both sides claiming the mantle of ultimate righteousness. Those opposed to the practice see themselves upholding sacred principles of re&not;spect for life, while those in favor raise the banner of humane treatment. After years on the de&not;fensive, the advocates now seem to be gaining ground. Recent polls in Britain show that 72 per&not;cent of British subjects favor euthanasia in some circumstances. An astonishing 76 percent of re&not;spondents to a poll taken last year in France said they would like the law changed to decriminalize mercy killings.<br />
Euthanasia has been a topic of controversy in Europe since at least 1936, when a bill was in&not;troduced in the House of Lords that would have legalized mercy killing under very tightly super&not;vised conditions. That bill failed, as have three others introduced in the House of Lords since then.<br />
Reasons for the latest surge of interest in euthanasia are not hard to find. Europeans, like Americans, are now living longer. Therefore, lingering chronic diseases have replaced critical ill&not;nesses as the primary cause of death. And the euthanasists argue that every human being should have the right to &quot;die with dignity,&quot; by which they usually mean the right to escape the horrors of a painful or degrading hospitalization (住院治疗)<br />
Most experts believe that euthanasia will continue to be practiced no matter what the law says.<br />
37. From the passage we can see that in Holland _____.<br />
A. a doctor who practices euthanasia will not be punished<br />
B. euthanasia is regarded as illegal<br />
C. euthanasia is very popular<br />
D. active euthanasia is still illegal, but people often tolerate an experienced doctor who car&not;ries it out<br />
38. What is the comment of the author on the problem of euthanasia? <br />
A. Euthanasia is not regarded as a crime in France.<br />
B. More and more medical workers like to practice euthanasia, no matter what form it takes. <br />
C. The problem of euthanasia is now being debated heatedly and openly. <br />
D. There is not much difference between &quot;active&quot; and &quot;passive&quot; euthanasia.<br />
39. Which of the following statements can not be found in the passage?<br />
A. Those opposed euthanasia say that they believe the right to live is sacred.<br />
B. Those in favor of euthanasia maintain that they are for humane treatment.<br />
C. Recently the advocates of euthanasia have got more support from the public<br />
D. More and more people like to have the law changed.<br />
40. What do you think is the standpoint of the author on this problem? <br />
A. He is a fence-sitter. <br />
B. He is afraid that the situation may get out of control. <br />
C. He is strongly against euthanasia. <br />
D. He supports euthanasia whole-heartedly. <br />
41. Which of the following is the most reasonable cause of euthanasia? <br />
A. People don't like to live too long.<br />
B. People don't like to suffer from lasting chronic diseases.<br />
C. People don't like to be hospitalized.<br />
D. People don't like to become a burden of others.<br />
42. The last sentence in the passage indicates that _____<br />
A. People will stop the practice of euthanasia immediately <br />
B. People will resume the practice of euthanasia only after it is allowed by law<br />
C. People will go on practicing euthanasia no matter it is passed by law or not<br />
D. Only passive euthanasia is allowed according to the law <br />
Passage Three<br />
Concern with money, and then more money, in order to buy the conveniences and luxuries of modern life, has brought great changes to the lives of most Frenchmen. More people are working than ever before in France. In the cities the traditional leisurely midday meal is disappearing. Off ices, shops and factories are discovering the greater efficiency of a short lunch hour in compa&not;ny lunchrooms. In almost all lines of work emphasis now falls on ever-increasing output. Thus the &quot;typical&quot; Frenchman produces more, earns more, and buys more consumer goods than his counterpart of only a generation ago. He gains in creature comforts and ease of life. What he lo&not;ses to some extent is his sense of personal uniqueness, or individuality.<br />
Some say that France has been Americanized. This is because the United States is a world symbol of the technological society and its consumer products. The so-called Americanization of France has its critics. They fear that &quot;assembly-line life&quot; will lead to the disappearance of the pleasures of the more graceful and leisurely old French style. What will happen, they ask, to taste, elegance, and the cultivation of the good things in life&mdash;to joy in the smell of a freshly picked apple, a stroll by the river, or just happy hours of conversation in a local cafe?<br />
Since the late 1950's life in France has indeed taken on qualities of rush, tension, and the pursuit of material gain. Some of the strongest critics of the new way of life are the young, espe&not;cially university students. They are concerned with the future, and they fear that France is threatened by the triumph of the competitive, goods-oriented culture. Occasionally, they have re&not;acted against the trend with considerable violence.<br />

<p>Passage Four<br />
When I was still an architecture student, a teacher told me, &quot;We learn more from buildings that fall down than from buildings that stand up.&quot; What he meant was that construction is as much the result of experience as of theory. Although structural design follows established formu&not;las, the actual performance of a building is complicated by the passage of time, the behavior of us&not;ers, the natural elements&mdash;and unnatural events. All are difficult to simulate. Buildings, unlike cars, can't be crash-tested.<br />
The first important lesson of the World Trade Center collapse is that tall buildings can with&not;stand the impact of a large jetliner. The twin towers were supported by 59 perimeter columns on each side. Although about 30 of these columns, extending from four to six floors, were destroyed in each building by the impact, initially both towers remained standing. Even so, the death toll (代价)was appalling---2245 people lost their lives.<br />
I was once asked how tall buildings should be designed given what we'd learned from the World Trade Center collapse. My answer was, &quot;Lower.&quot; The question of when a tall building becomes unsafe is easy to answer. Common aerial fire-fighting ladders in use today are 100 feet high and can reach to about the 10th floor, so fires in buildings up to 10 stories high can be fought from the exterior (外部). Fighting fires and evacuating occupants above that height depend on fire stairs. The taller the building, the longer it will take for firefighters to climb to the scene of the fire. So the simple answer to the safety question is &quot;Lower than 10 stories.&quot; Then why don't cities impose lower height limits? A 60-story office building does not have six times as much rentable space as a 10-story building. However, all things being equal, such a building will produce four times more revenue and four times more in property taxes. So cutting building heights would mean cutting city budgets.<br />
The most important lesson of the World Trade Center collapse is not that we should stop building tall buildings but that we have misjudged their cost. We did the same thing .when we un&not;derestimated the cost of hurtling along a highway in a steel box at 70 miles per hour. It took many years before seat belts, air bags, radial tires, and antilock brakes became commonplace. At first, cars simply were too slow to warrant concern. Later, manufacturers resisted these expen&not;sive devices, arguing that consumers would not pay for safety. Now we do&mdash;willingly. <br />
49. The first paragraph tells us that _____.<br />
A. architecture is something more out of experience than out of theory <br />
B. architecture depends just as much on experience as on theory<br />
C. it is safer for people to live in old buildings&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
D. we learn not so much from our failures as from our success<br />
50. What can we learn from the WTC collapse?<br />
A. Although the structure of the two buildings was very strong, the death toll was still very shocking.<br />
B. The structure of the two buildings was of the first class.<br />
C. The structure of the two buildings was not so strong as people had expected.<br />
D. The structure of the two buildings was strong enough to withstand any accidents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :<br />
51. Ideally, the policy in city construction should be _____. <br />
A. lower than ten stories&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. the lower, the better&nbsp;&nbsp; C. the higher, the better&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. higher than ten stories&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
52. Why are there still high buildings, or even skyscrapers in many cities?<br />
A. Because they are the symbol of modern time. <br />
B. Because many cities now lack building space. <br />
C. Because high buildings are an important financial source of a city's budget. <br />
D. Because high buildings represent the level of a country's science and technology.<br />
53. What is the most important lesson of the WTC collapse?<br />
A. We should wear seat belts while driving.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
B. We should build low buildings just as we should drive slowly. <br />
C. We should make building tall buildings illegal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
D. We should pay for safety while constructing tall buildings.&nbsp; <br />
54. What is the author's attitude towards building tall buildings? <br />
A. positive&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. neutral&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. indifferent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. critical</p>
<p>Passage Five<br />
He is a rare celebrity scientist. He's even had a TV cameo role (小角色) in Star Trek in which he plays poker with scientific icons (偶像)Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. Yet when asked about comparisons between himself and the two scientists, he calls it all &quot;media hype(炒作). &quot; Once asked how he felt about being labeled the world's smartest person, he responded:&quot; It is very embarrassing. It is rubbish, just media hype. They just want a hero, and I fill the role model of a disabled genius. At least I am disabled, but I am no genius.&quot;<br />
Hawking has ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, a neuromuscular disease that progressively weakens muscle control. He gets around in a wheelchair, and after completely losing the use of his vocal chords in an operation to assist his breathing in 1985, he communicates through a computer. A speech synthesizer &quot;speaks&quot; for him after he punches in what he wants to say, selecting words in the computer software by pressing a switch with his hand. Unfortunately, it makes him sound like he has an American accent, he says.<br />
Despite his humorous, self-effacing manner, Hawking is one of the world's leading theoreti&not;cal physicists. Many consider him to be the most brilliant since Einstein. Since 1979,he's held the post of Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge University&mdash;which was once held by Isaac Newton no less&mdash;-and has twelve honorary degrees. He's also a best-selling author. His book, A Brief History of Time, has been translated into 33 languages and has sold nine million copies.<br />
For much of his academic life, Hawking has been among a group of theoretical physicists searching for a &quot;theory of everything&quot;&mdash;one unified scientific theory that explains the big cosmological questions like How did the universe begin? Why is the universe the way it is? And How will it end?<br />
You are probably familiar with the existing theories, such as the Big Bang theory. However, these theories are inconsistent with each other. So Hawking---among a group of theoretical phys&not;icists---has been on a quest to come up with a theory of quantum (量子)gravity that would incor&not;porate these theories&mdash;the theory of everything (TOE)---which would solve the problem of what caused the universe to start expanding.<br />
How successful have the world's leading cosmologists been? Hawking predicts we'll have the<br />
TOE in the next 20 years.<br />
55. From the first paragraph we can see that Hawking _____<br />
A. is a very famous scientist <br />
B. can be compared with Newton and Einstein <br />
C. is a very good actor. <br />
D. has surpassed any scientists known in the world<br />
56. In this passage, Hawking appears to be ____<br />
A. silent and hard working&nbsp;<br />
B. humorous, modest and industrious&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
C. confident and proud&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
D. diffident and shy<br />
57. Why does Hawking communicate with others through a computer?<br />
A. He is too weak to speak. <br />
B. He is a computer addict.&nbsp; <br />
C. An operation to help his breathing made him unable to pronounce. <br />
D. His illness makes him unable to speak.&nbsp; <br />
58. Which of the following is NOT Hawking&rsquo;s occupation?<br />
A. author&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. physicist&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. doctor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. actor<br />
59. The leading theoretical physicists are searching for a &quot;theory of everything&quot; because _____.<br />
A. the existing theories are out of date<br />
B. the theories are not enough<br />
C. some of the theories are wrong<br />
D. the existing theories are somewhat contradictory to each other<br />
60. Hawking and his colleagues are working hard to try to find _____.<br />
A. a new theory to replace the Big Bang theory&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
B. a new theory to replace Einstein's general theory of relativity<br />
C. a theory that can incorporate the existing theories <br />
D. an all-powerful theory that can explain everything in the world&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Parents can no more be friends to their children than teachers can be to their students. For the essence of friendship is reciprocity (互惠): giving and getting something like 61 you give. Parents 62 to the proper development of their children, and teachers guide the sha&not;ping of their students' minds.<br />
It should be 63 now why real friendship requires more than merely having &quot; 64&nbsp; in common.&quot; It is what people have in common 65 determines the kind of friendship they will have. Real friendship requires at least a sound moral character out of the richness of which individuals are able to&nbsp; 66&nbsp; this precious affection. The more individuals give, the more they realize a genuine kind of&nbsp; 67 ,the better friends they are. A good man will not only do for his friend what he would do for&nbsp; 68&nbsp; but also, if necessary, do&nbsp; 69 .<br />
&nbsp;These prerequisites are hard to fulfill, true friendship is 70 to be rare. To acquire a real friend, 71 ,is one of the most praiseworthy accomplishments in&nbsp; 72&nbsp; Montaigne tells a story of Cyrus, the 73 of Persia. He was asked whether he would change a valuable horse, on 74 he had just won a race, for a kingdom. Cyrus replied, &quot;No, surely, sir, but I would give him up with all my heart to gain a true friend, could I find out any man 75 of that alliance.&quot;</p>
