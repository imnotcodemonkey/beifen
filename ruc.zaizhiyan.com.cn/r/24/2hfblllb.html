Part III&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading Comprehension(45 minutes,30 points,! for each)<br />
Directions: There are 5 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are 4 choices marked A,B, C and D. Choose the best one and mark the corresponding letter with a single bar across the square brackets on your machine scoring ANSWER SHEET.<br />
Passage One<br />
It's a classic mystery of the deep. Why does the hammerhead shark (M. H It) have the bizarrely shaped head from which it gets its name?<br />
There have been a variety of suggested explanations. Some simply say that the sharks use their heads to&quot;hammer&quot;and pin down their favourite food. More plausibly,others have specula&not;ted that the wide lobes(EIJI^^tB p$4)~) of the hammerhead allow it to have longer electrorecep-tors,the organs that all sharks use to detect the electric fields produced by nearby prey. This might allow hammerheads to sense subtler electric fields from more distant prey than their nar&not;row-headed cousins.<br />
Now it turns out that the shark's head does indeed help it find and capture prey, but not in the way that zoologists expected. Stephen Kajlura and Kim Holland of the University of Hawaii at Manoa set out to test the conventional theory by tricking young sharks into chasing phantom (it Hi W) prey. Using a system of wires on the bottom of a shallow pool, they set up electric fields that mimicked those created by the bottom-dwelling shrimp and fish that form the sharks' usual diet. Sure enough,hungry sharks abruptly turned towards an electric field when they detected it. But when the researchers measured the distance at which this happened they found it was the same for 13 young hammerheads as it was for 12 young sandbar sharks (?&pound; ^| H), which have normal-shaped heads.<br />
The two types of sharks proved equally adept at sensing the electric fields: each was able to detect the source from up to 30 centimetres away. That ruled out any improved sensitivity from the wider head. However,the hammerheads enjoy another more prosaicC^pf^^^f ($)advantage: their wider heads let them sweep more than twice as wide a swathe of the seafloor as they swim, which must boost their chance of encountering food.<br />
The researchers also found that hammerheads could turn more sharply when they detected the phantom prey. &quot;They're a much more bendy shark,&quot;says Kajlura,who is now at the Univer&not;sity of California at Irvine. In part,that's because they have more slender bodies than the sand&not; bar sharks. However,Kajiura has other unpublished data that suggests that the hammerheads' broad heads can act as fins to improve manoeuvrability($flzSli&pound;).&nbsp;- .<br />
So far, the researchers have only experimented with young sharks, so adult hammerheads may gain some other advantage from their head shape.<br />
31. The passage is mainly about_____.. <br />
A. the different species of sharks&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;B. the differences between hammerhead and sandbar sharks<br />
C. how hammerhead sharks detect their prey<br />
D. special functions of the hammerhead sharks<br />
32. Which of the following is a feature that the hammerhead shark shares with other sharks? <br />
A. They have slender bodies.<br />
&nbsp;B. They have wide lobes.<br />
C. They use electroreceptors to detect prey. <br />
D. They sense electric fields from far away. <br />
33. What did Stephen Kajlura and Kirn Holland initially want to prove by the experiment? A. hammerheads have slender bodies than sandbar sharks.<br />
B. hammerheads could sense subtler electric fields than sandbar sharks.<br />
C. hammerheads could sweep more food than sandbar sharks.<br />
D. adult hammerheads may have more advantages than young hammerheads.<br />
34. The experiment conducted by Stephen Kajlura and Kim Holland proves that ______.<br />
A. the conventional theory is wrong<br />
B. phantom prey are as attractive as real ones<br />
C. hammerhead sharks can find more distant prey<br />
D. the wider head of the hammerhead shark provides more sensitivity<br />
35.&nbsp; The conclusion made by Stephen Kajlura and Kim Holland is that hammerhead sharks<br />
A. use their heads to pin down their favorite food B. have more and longer electroreceptors C. have more chances to encounter food D. swim much faster than other sharks<br />
36. One of the reasons why hammerhead sharks can turn more swiftly than sandbar sharks is that they have _____.<br />
A. big heads&nbsp;B. slender bodies<br />
C. wide lobes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. big fins<br />
Passage Two<br />
Ethiopians appear to have evolved a unique way of coping with thin mountain air. But how they do it remains a mystery.<br />
One way for the body to get enough oxygen to its tissues when breathing oxygen-poor air is for it to make more red blood cells. This increases the amount of hemoglobin (StSL &amp;LS &amp; )&gt; the protein that carries oxygen. Although less haemoglobin in the arteries is saturated with oxygen at high altitudes, having more of it makes up for the shortfall.<br />
People native to the high Andes are known to have more red blood cells than lowlanders, and athletes who train at altitude can increase their concentration of cells.<br />
But while many Tibetans also live at high altitudes, they do not have significantly elevated levels of haemoglobin. Instead they seem to boost the amount of nitric oxide, which dilates (ft0IK) blood vessels and increases blood flow.<br />
Now Cynthia Beall, an anthropologist from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, has found a third kind of adaptation. When she tested the blood of 236 people in the Ambaras region in the Semien Mountains of Ethiopia, she found that 95 percent of the haemoglobin in their arteries is saturated with oxygen, almost as much as that of people living at low altitudes and roughly 5 per cent above that of residents in the Andes or Tibet. <br />
&quot;That shouldn't be, &quot;says Beall. They must have a massively efficient way to get oxygen from the lungs to the blood, she says. But just what remains mysterious. They do not have higher concentrations of haemoglobin than anyone else, nor do they have a different kind of haemoglobin. Beall adds that this ability might be found in all people living in that part of the world, and not just those in the study. It might be why so many world-class endurance athletes are Ethiopian. &quot;The next study needs to look at that,&quot; she says.<br />
37. From the passage we learn that haemoglobin is a kind of _____.<br />
A. oxygen&nbsp;B. blood cell&nbsp; <br />

Passage Three<br />
Entrepreneurs are everybody's darlings these days. They may be small, but they are innova&not;tive. And innovation, we are assured, is the main engine of economic growth.<br />
For policymakers every where, the task is to get the little critters to nest and breed. Give them the conditions they like&mdash;plenty of venture capital, tax breaks and a risk-taking culture&mdash;and the sun will shine on all of us, just like in California.<br />
Along comes Amar Bhide to tell us most of this is plain wrong. Entrepreneurs, he asserts, are not risk-takers at all. Nor do most of them innovate,or depend on venture capital. <br />
His findings are striking enough. Start with his assertion that entrepreneurs are not innovators or risk-takers. The vast majority of new businesses, he points out, start small and stay that way. These are the hairdressing salons, corner shops and landscape gardeners. Those are mature, predictable industries. For just that reason, they are the least profitable.<br />
The success stories come in areas of high uncertainty: where markets are changing fast because of technology, regulation or fashion. A very large proportion, unsurprisingly, are in computing.<br />
But Mr. Bhide insists they are rarely innovative. The people who start high-growth businesses take a humdrum idea, usually from someone else, then change it constantly to fit the market. The starting point is much less important than what happens next.<br />
Nor are they risk-takers. These are typically young people, with no money, expertise or status. They have nothing to lose. Risk arrives later on, when they have made their pile and must decide whether to invest in long-term growth or sell out.<br />
This is one reason why so few promising start-ups become a Dell or Microsoft. Taking planned, calculated risks is the job of big, established companies, Mr. Bhide argues. True entrepreneurs rarely have the temperament for it.<br />
What they have, instead, is a high tolerance for ambiguity&mdash;defined as knowledge that you know you do not have. Few of Mr. Bhide's interviewees began with any kind of business plan. That would have been a waste of time: the future was simply too uncertain. Therein lay their opportunity.<br />
Big companies may be happy with risk, but they cannot stand ambiguity. They can invest billions in a chip plant or oil field, but only when they know the odds. When the odds are unknown, entrepreneurs have the game to themselves.<br />
those objectives all too perfectly. After the attacks, people stopped flying. Why? Not because they had made a rational risk assessment but because the mere thought of flying made their palms sweat.<br />
From terrorism to rail crashes,counseling and&quot;debriefing&quot;are the standard response to help those caught up in disasters. But there are growing doubts about their effectiveness. What might be going wrong? Debriefing focuses on getting people to talk through the trauma (&reg;J $j) and its emotional consequences soon after the incident. Could it be that some people are better by distancing themselves from what happened,rather than retelling it?<br />
49. Disaster psychology refers to the study of how to _____. A. avoid human-created disasters B. cope with human reactions to disasters C. reduce the worst natural disasters D. prevent growing terrorism<br />
50. The passage tells us that disaster psychology is_____. A. a highly controversial area B. a well-established science C. not associated with terrorism D. not a part of scientific study<br />
51. According to Dennis Embry,how do terrorists reach their goals? A. By overlooking the most obvious of everyday life. B. By setting up new symbols for a nation's daily life. C. By turning symbols of everyday life into fear and anxiety stimulant. D. Through hijacking big planes from the most famous international airlines.<br />
52. Why do people usually stop flying after terrorist attacks? A. Because they are terrified of flying. B. Because they believe in rational risk assessment. C. Because their palms will become too sweaty for them to fly. D. Because they can't decide which airline will be the safest.<br />
53. Counseling and debriefing may not be effective methods because _____. A. there is fierce controversy in this area B. many research have proved this C. some people may hide their true feelings D. some people may feel better to forget the disaster<br />
54. The word&quot;debriefing&quot;(Line l,Para 4)may probably mean EXCEPT_____.<br />
A. making a report after the disaster<br />
B. questioning about details in the process of disaster<br />
C. saving people from keeping remembering the horrible things<br />
D. retelling what happened in the incident<br />
Passage Five<br />
Architects are hopeless when it comes to deciding whether the public will view their designs<br />
as marvels or monstrosities,according to a study by Canadian psychologists. They say designers<br />
should go back to school to learn about ordinary people's tastes.&nbsp;,<br />
Many buildings that appeal to architects get the thumbs down from the public. Robert Gifford of the University of Victoria in British Columbia decided to find out whether architects understand public preferences and simply disagree with them, or fail to understand the lay person's view.<br />
With his colleague Graham Brown,he asked 25 experienced architects to look at photos of 42 large buildings in the US, Canada, Europe and Hong Kong. The architects predicted how the public would rate the buildings on a scale of 1 to 10,where 1 represented&quot;terrible&quot;and 10&quot;excellent&quot;. A further 27 people who were not architects also scored the buildings out of 10. In addition,eight architects gave their own personal ratings of the buildings.<br />
The three groups tended to agree among themselves on a building's merits. And architects correctly predicted that lay people would on average rate buildings higher than they did them-selves. But for individual buildings, the architects' perceptions of what the lay people would think were often way off the mark. &quot;Some architects are quite good at predicting lay preferences, but others are not only poor at it,they get it backwards,&quot;says Gifford.<br />
For instance,architects gave the Stockley Park Building B-3 offices in London a moderate rat&not;ing of 5. 2. They thought the public would like it much better,predicting a rating of 6. 3. But the public actually disliked the off ices, and gave it 4. 7. Gifford thinks that lay people respond to specific features of buildings,such as durability and originality,and hopes to pin down what they are.<br />
&quot;Architects in architecture school need to be taught how lay people think about buildings,&quot; Gifford concludes. He doesn't think designers should pander to the lowest common denominator, but suggests they should aspire towards buildings that appeal to the public and architects alike, such as the Bank of China building in Hong Kong.<br />
Marco Goldschmeid of the Richard Rogers Partnership, designers of the Millennium Dome in London,thinks the study is flawed. &quot;The authors have assumed, wrongly, that buildings can be meaningfully judged from photographs rather than actual visits,&quot;he says. Goldschmeid thinks it would be more significant and interesting to look at the divergence of public taste between generations.<br />
55. What does the first paragraph of this passage imply?<br />
A. Architects have a dark future in designing marvelous buildings.<br />
B. Architects don't care about how ordinary people view their designs.<br />
C. It is very difficult for architects to please the general public.<br />
D. Architects don't know much about the public tastes for buildings.<br />
56. What does&quot;lay person&quot;in Line 3,Paragraph 2 possibly mean?<br />
A. lazy person&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. common person&nbsp;&nbsp; C. officer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. construction worker<br />
57. Through his study,Robert Gifford found that_____.<br />
A.&nbsp; the three groups had similar responses to the photos of 42 large buildings<br />
B. the architects generally rated buildings lower than lay people<br />
C. the architects predicted precisely the preferences of lay people<br />
D. no architect could predict the public tastes towards buildings accurately<br />
58. From the passage we can learn that the Bank of China building in Hong Kong _____. A. panders to the lowest common denominator<br />
B. gets a low rate from the architects<br />
C. appeals to the public as well as the architects<br />
D. gives the architects a lot of aspiration<br />
59. Marco Goldschmeid thinks that Gifford's study is flawed because _____. <br />
A. it uses photos instead of actual visits <br />
B. it ignores the public tastes between generations <br />
C. it lacks the necessary significance and interests <br />
D. it doesn't take into account the differences within the public<br />
60. What does the passage mainly deal with?<br />
A. How to design attractive buildings.<br />
B. Architects need to understand public tastes.<br />
C. How lay people view buildings.<br />
D. Different tastes between architects and the public.<br />

<p>Not too long ago,a guest checking out of our Polynesian Village resort at Walt Disney World was asked how she enjoyed her visit. She&nbsp;&nbsp; 61&nbsp; the front-desk clerk she had had a wonderful vaca&not;tion, but was heartbroken about losing several rolls of Kodacolor film she had not yet&nbsp;&nbsp; 62&nbsp; She was particularly upset over the loss of the&nbsp; 63&nbsp; she had shot at our Polynesian Luau,as this was a memory she especially treasured. <br />
Now, please 64 that we have no written service standards covering lost luau snap&not;shots. 65 ,the hostess at the front desk understood Disney's philosophy of caring for our guests. She asked the 66 to leave her a couple of rolls of fresh 67 promising she would take care of the 68<br />
Two weeks 69 ,this guest received a package at her home. In 70 were photos of the entire cast of our luau show, personally autographed by each performer. There were also 71 of the parade and fireworks in the theme park, 72 by the front-desk 73 on her own time, after work. I happen to 74 this story because this guest wrote us a letter. She said that never in her life had she received such compassionate 75 from any business establishment. Heroic service does not come from policy manuals. It comes from people who care &mdash; and from a culture that encourages and models that attitude.<br />
