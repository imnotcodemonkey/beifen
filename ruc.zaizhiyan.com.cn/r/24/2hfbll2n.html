Part III&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading Comprehension (45 minutes, 30 points, 1 for each)<br />
Directions: There are 5 passages in this part.&nbsp; Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are 4 choices marked A, B, C and D. Choose the best one and mark the corresponding letter with a single bar across the square brackets on your machine scoring ANSWER SHEET.<br />
Passage One<br />
Gravity is a slippery beast. We don't know how strong it is, how it works or how fast its<br />
effects move. But this year we made progress.<br />
October saw the most accurate measurement yet of Newton's gravitational constant (引力常数),G, a measure of the strength of the gravitational interaction between two objects. A Swiss team calculated G's value by measuring how the gravitational pull of two huge tanks of mercury affected the weights of test masses.<br />
However, there are discrepancies between measurements of G made in different labs. This year a highly contentious(有争议的) explanation for this was proposed. A group of string theo&not;rists proposed that gravity is subtly affected by magnetic fields, and that G should be larger near Earth's poles where the magnetic field is stronger. Sure enough, this fits with the measurements so far. So G's varying values might just be the first proof of the hidden dimensions predicted by string theory.<br />
Equally tantalizing is possible evidence for the existence of gravitational waves, the ripples in space-time supposedly caused by abrupt, violent cosmic events. An Italian team reported that two massive aluminum bars, one at CERN(欧洲粒子物理研究所) near Geneva, the other in Italy, had once vibrated in unison (一致)&mdash;perhaps as a result of a passing gravitational wave, they suggest.<br />
The claims will be closely scrutinized by gravity researchers in Washington state. They got to turn on a very expensive toy this year: LIGO, one of the biggest scientific instruments ever built. Its twin sets of intersecting 4-kilometre-long laser beams should be very sensitive to any waves. But so far the $ 400-million machine has not seen anything.<br />
At least one gravitational mystery has (hopefully) been wrapped up this year: when you move something, how long before its new position will affect its gravitational pull on surrounding objects? In other words, what is the speed of gravity? Newton thought the effect instantaneous, but Einstein said it could travel no faster than the speed of light.<br />
Astronomers have finally devised a way to test which one of them was right, based on the way gravity bends radio waves from a distant quasar(类星体). They finished the experiment in September. We don't yet know the answer but our money is on Einstein.<br />
31. Why is gravitation considered to be a slippery beast?<br />
A. Because it gives people so much trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
B. Because it is much stronger than expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
C. Because no progress has been made about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
D. Because it remains largely unknown to people.<br />
32. What kind of metal did the Swiss team use to calculate the G's value?<br />
A. gold&nbsp;B. silver&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. mercury&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. lead<br />
33. A highly controversial explanation proposed by string theorists is that _____. <br />
A. magnetic fields affect gravity subtly<br />
B. G is larger near the Earth's poles<br />
C. G has a number of hidden dimensions<br />
D. discrepancies emerge between measures of G<br />
34. The report given by the Italian team might provide evidence that _____. <br />
A. two things far apart might vibrate in unison <br />
B. the ripples in space-time are only imagined <br />
C. there exist gravitational waves <br />

35. Until now LIGO has _____. <br />
A. never been turned on yet <br />

D. found no gravitational waves<br />
36. From the passage we can infer that _____.<br />
A. Newton and Einstein had similar opinions on the speed of gravity <br />
B. the author of the passage is in favor of Einstein's thought about the speed of gravity <br />
C. astronomers think that both Newton and Einstein were wrong on the speed of gravity <br />
D. Newton's thought about the gravitational effect is out of date</p>
<p>Passage Two<br />
What makes teenagers moody and impulsive? The answer used to be raging hormones plus a dearth of(短缺) life experiences. But three years ago this simple equation was blown apart by evidence from brain scans of strange goings-on behind the teenage forehead.<br />
Till then, scientists had thought the brain's internal structure was fixed by the end of child&not;hood. The new scans showed the brain's frontal cortex(皮层) thickening just before puberty(青春期),then slowly shrinking back to normal during the teenage years. Suddenly, the erratic huffiness (发怒) seemed to make sense: the teenage brain was a work in progress, a house in the process of being rewired.<br />
Now comes more evidence of neural turmoil. According to psychologists in California, the speed with which youngsters can read the emotional expressions on people's faces dips suddenly at around the age of 11 or 12 and takes years to get back on track.<br />
The latest study, like the brain scan research before it, is a welcome and necessary part of building up a picture of a typical teenage brain so that scientists can get a better handle on what might be happening in the mental illnesses that appear to be afflicting children and adolescents in ever greater numbers. But there are dangers.<br />
Scientists still have no idea how to interpret the subtle changes seen in adolescent brain scans. Yet in the wrong hands, these findings could be used to justify hothousing, impulse control training and other dubious attempts to get the most out of malleable teenage brain cells. The science could also spark a new wave of moralizing based on a perceived need to protect teenagers' evolving brain connections from evil or toxic influences.<br />
Incredibly, some scientists have already suggested in the press that the brain scan evidence somehow proves that it is biologically bad for teenagers to play video games or lie on the couch watching MTV. A hundred years ago one well-known &quot;expert&quot; urged teenage boys to drink six to eight glasses of hot water a day to flush impure thoughts from their bodies. Have we really learned so little?<br />
37. In the past it was thought that teenagers were moody and impulsive because of _____. <br />
A. their innocence and lack of life experience <br />
B. their raging hormones and lack of life experience <br />
C. their radical attitudes towards life <br />
D. the generation gap between teenagers and their parents<br />
38. In the last line, paragraph two, &quot;a house in the process of being rewired&quot; indicates that _____.<br />
A. teenagers like to live in a house rewired<br />
B. teenagers' brain structure like a house<br />
C. teenage brain is working in progress like a house being rewired <br />
D. teenager tend not to get erratic huffiness if the house is rewired<br />
39. From the passage we can learn that _____. <br />
A. the teenage brain is a kind of work in progress <br />
B. the new brain scans support the conventional thought <br />
C. the brain's frontal cortex becomes bigger during the teenager years <br />
D. at the age of 11 or 12 teenagers are unable to find out people's true feelings<br />
40. The latest study is very helpful in that _____.<br />
A. it can take clearer pictures of teenagers' brains on<br />
B. scientists will meet with fewer dangers in their research work<br />
C. it may help scientists understand better the mental illness in teenagers<br />
D. it may enable teenagers to experience fewer dangers during teenager years<br />
41. According to paragraph five, which of the following statements reflects the present medical reality?<br />
A. It is biologically bad for teenagers to play games or lie on the couch watching MTV.<br />
B. Teenager boys should drink six or eight glasses, of hot water in the morning everyday.<br />
C. Scientists should apply the findings of brain scans to practical use as soon as possible.<br />
D. Scientists still don't know how to explain the subtle changes seen in teenager brain scans. <br />
42. The author's attitude towards the findings of teenagers' brain scans can be concluded as _____.<br />
A. cautious&nbsp;B. positive&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. prejudiced&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. neutral</p>
<p>Passage Three<br />
Is nothing sacred? Even the idle weekend pastime of skimming stones on a lake has been taken apart and reduced to a mathematical formula.<br />
Everyone knows a stone bounces best on water if it's round and flat, and spun towards the water as fast as possible. Some enthusiasts even travel to international stone-skimming competi&not;tions, like world champion Jerdone Coleman-McGhee, who made a stone bounce 38 times on Blanco River, Texas, in 1992.<br />
Intuitively, a flat stone works best because a relatively large part of its surface strikes the water, so there's more bounce. Inspired by his eight-year-old son, physicist Lyderic Bocquet of Lyon University in France wanted to find out more. So he tinkered with some simple equations describing a stone bouncing on water in terms of its radius(半径),speed and spin, and taking ac&not;count of gravity and the water's drag.<br />
The equations showed that the faster a spinning stone is travelling, the more times it will bounce. So no surprise there. To bounce at least once without sinking, Bocquet found the stone needs to be travelling at a minimum speed of about 1 kilometer per hour.<br />
And the equations also backed his hunch (直觉) that spin is important because it keeps the stone fairly flat from one bounce to the next. The spin has a gyroscopic (陀螺的) effect, preventing the stone from tipping and falling sideways into the water.<br />
To match the world record of 38 bounces using a 10-centimetre-wide stone, Bocquet' predicts it would have to be travelling at about 40 kilometers per hour and spinning at 14 revolutions a second. He adds that drilling lots of small pits in the stone would probably help, by reducing wa&not;ter drag in the same way that dim pies on a golf ball reduce air drag. &quot;Although I suppose that would be cheating,&quot; says Bocquet.<br />
He and his team at Lyon hope to design a motorized &quot;catapult&quot; that can throw stones onto a lake with a precise speed and spin, to test if the predictions stand up.&nbsp; <br />
Bocquet adds that he's probably just rediscovering a piece of history. British engineer Barnes Wallis must have done the same sort of maths and experiments when he was designing his famous bouncing bombs for the Dambusters squadron (中队) during the Second World War.<br />
43. Which of the following could be the best title for this passage? <br />
A. International stone-skimming competitions. <br />
B. How to make stone-skimming more enjoyable.<br />
C. Stone-skimming is a sacred thing.<br />
D. The mathematical formula for stone-skimming.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
44. In order to make a stone bounce best on water, one needs to _____. <br />
A. find a big, round stone<br />
B. reduce the spin of the stone<br />
C. make the stone spin as fast as possible<br />
D. do some complicated mathematical equations&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
purchases or whatever. Ten or twenty dollar checks are accepted like this almost always and<br />
you'll be given change just as though you'd presented the cashier with dollar bills. Be prepared<br />
to show I.D. when you cash your checks.<br />
&nbsp;Credit cards can be even more valuable than travelers' checks, as they are often used to<br />
guarantee room reservations over the phone and are accepted in lieu of deposit when renting a<br />
car&mdash;indeed without a credit card you may be considered so untrustworthy that not only a<br />
deposit but your passport will be held as security too. The major credit cards are VISA, Master<br />
Charge and Access, Diners Club and American Express. If you hold a bank card, it could well be<br />
worthwhile to increase your credit limit for travel purposes&mdash;you should ask your bank<br />

Passage Five<br />
Language learning begins with listening. Individual children vary greatly in the amount of listening they do before they start speaking, and late starters are often long listeners. Most chil&not;dren will &quot;obey&quot; spoken instructions some time before they can speak, though the word &quot;obey&quot; is hardly accurate as a description of the eager and delighted cooperation usually shown by the child. Before they can speak, many children will also ask questions by gestures and by making questioning noises.<br />
Any attempt to trace the development from the noises babies make to their first spoken words leads to considerable difficulties. It is agreed that they enjoy making noises, and that dur&not;ing the first few months one or two noises sort themselves out as particularly indicative of de&not;light, distress, sociability, and so on. But since these cannot be said to show the baby's intention to communicate, they can hardly be regarded as early forms of language. It is agreed, too, that from about three months they play with sounds for enjoyment, and that by six months they are able to add new sounds to their store. This self-imitation leads on to deliberate imitation of sounds made or words spoken to them by other people. The problem then arisen so to the point at which one can say that these imitations can be considered as speech.<br />
It is a problem we need not get our teeth into. The meaning of a word depends on what a particular person means by it in a particular situation; and it is clear that what a child means by a word will change as he gains more experience of the world. Thus the use, at say seven months, of &quot;mama&quot; as a greeting for his mother cannot be dismissed as a meaningless sound simply be&not;cause he also uses it at other times for his father, his dog, or anything else he likes.<br />
Playful and apparently meaningless imitation of what other people say continues after the child has begun to speak for himself. I doubt, however, whether anything is gained when parents cash in on this ability in an attempt to teach new sounds. <br />
55. Children who start speaking late _____. <br />
A. may have problems with their hearing<br />
B. usually pay close attention to what they hear<br />
C. often take a long time in learning to listen properly <br />
D. probably do not hear enough language spoken around them<br />
56. How many months old does child play with sounds not only for enjoyment?<br />
A. three months&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. two months&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. five months&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. six months<br />
57. According to the second paragraphs baby's first noises are _____.<br />
A. a sign that he means to tell you something&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
B. a reflection of his moods and feelings&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
C. can imitation of the spoken of adults&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
D. an early form of language<br />
58. The problem of deciding at what point a baby's imitations can be considered as speech<br />
A. it remains unclear so far and remains to be further observed and made clear<br />
B. is important because words have different meanings for different people <br />
C. is one that can never be properly understood because the meaning of words changes with age<br />
D. is one that should be completely ignored because children's use of words in often meaningless <br />
59. It is implied in the passage that&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
A. parents can never hope to teach their children new sounds<br />
B. children no longer imitate people after they begin to speak<br />
C. even after they have learnt to speak children still enjoy imitating&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
D. children who are good at imitating learn new words more quickly&nbsp; <br />
60. It can be inferred from the passage that when a 7-month baby calls his or her mother &quot;ma&not;ma&quot; _____.<br />
A. he probably has known that mother should be called in this way <br />
B. he probably does not know the sound stands for &quot;mother&quot; <br />
C. he probably has already known .the meaning of mama <br />
D. it is the first meaningful sound pronounced by him<br />
Part IV&nbsp; Cloze (15 minutes, 15 points, I for each)<br />
Directions: The following are a list of 15 words and phrases and a passage with 15 blanks. Read the passage carefully and choose one word or phrase from the list for each of the blanks in the passage. Change the form of the words and phrases if necessary. Write your answers on the ANSWER SHEET.<br />

Participant observation also reflects anthropology's dual nature as both a scientific and a hu-manistic discipline. Through the stress on the participation and getting the insider's view, anthropologists&nbsp; 61 necessity become personally involved with their subjects. They show a humanistic concern&nbsp; 62&nbsp; the people they study, and&nbsp; 63&nbsp; their attempts to understand and describe people's behavior they help give outsiders a rich appreciation for other people and others' ways.&nbsp; 64&nbsp;&nbsp; , with its stress on observation, anthropologists strive to fulfill the re&not;quirements of a scientific discipline. Anthropologists strive for objectivity and accuracy. They often&nbsp; 65&nbsp; count, for example, the number of times specific behavior patterns occur under certain circumstances; they use this data for empirical studies&nbsp; 66&nbsp; integrate their observa&not;tions into general laws of human behavior.<br />
Understanding anthropology requires understanding its dual nature. Perhaps the following two inelegant 67__ useful terms borrowed from linguistics will help. Emit refers to the ar&not;ray of categories (and their systematic relationships) through which the bearers of a particular culture perceive the world. Epic&nbsp; 68&nbsp; the array of categories (and their systematic relation&not;ships) used by the Western 69 scientists to explain the world.&nbsp; 70&nbsp; , the emit view is the insiders' view. Pierre's emit view of his death,&nbsp; 71&nbsp; ,is that he died from the power of the sorcerer (魔术师); anthropologist's epic view is that he died from physiological effects of fear, 72&nbsp; by his belief in the sorcerer. Both views are&nbsp; 73&nbsp; for the proper circum&not;stances, but anthropologists requires that they&nbsp; 74&nbsp; clearly distinguished from each other because they derive from different methodologies, consist of different kinds of data,&nbsp; 75&nbsp; lead to different types of knowledge. Together they facilitate a complete understanding of a cul&not;ture. Anthropology's uniqueness lies in the fact that it encompasses them both.</p>

Part I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Translation (30 minutes, 20 points, 10 for each section)<br />
Section A<br />
Directions:&nbsp; Translate the following passage into Chinese.&nbsp;&nbsp; Write your translation on the ANSWER SHEET.<br />
The American Economy just isn't looking up these days. The growth rate for this quarter will probably be close to zero. Unemployment is rising. The stock market remains sluggish(缓滞的). And now many worry that the growing economic stagnation (停滞) abroad will affect the United States. With trouble spots multiplying around the globe, investors are already coming to the conclusion that the safest place to put their money is in the U.S.A.<br />
How else to explain the gravity-defying feat of the dollar? By all economic logic, the dollar should fall when the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. But as any American tourist knows, the greenback has been firming up against the euro and the yen despite six rate cuts this year. Euro&not;pean and Asian investors are using their savings to buy American bonds even though they can get higher interest rates in their own countries.</p>

<p>Part II Writing (30 minutes, 15 points)<br />
Directions; In this part, there is a passage of about 500 words. You are allowed 30 minutes to write a summary of no less than 120 words of the following passage after reading it. Please remember to write it on the COMPOSITION SHEET. <br />
Education in Britain and the U. S. A<br />
In Britain all children have to go to school between the ages of 5 and 16. In the US children must go to school from the age of 6 to between the ages of 14 and 16, depending on the state they live in. Subjects<br />
In England and Wales the subjects taught in schools are laid down by the National Curriculum, which was introduced in 1988 and sets out in detail the subjects that children should study and the levels of achievement they should reach by the ages of 7, 11, 14 and 16, when they are tested. The National Curriculum does not apply in Scotland, where each school decides what subjects it will teach.<br />
In the US the subjects taught are decided by the national and local governments. Whereas British schools usually have prayers and religious instruction, American schools are not allowed to include prayers or to teach particular religious beliefs. <br />
Examinations<br />
At 16 students in England and Wales take GCSE examinations. These examinations are taken by students of all levels of ability in any of a range of subjects and may involve a final ex&not;amination, an assessment of work done during the two-year course, or both of these things. At 18 some students taking A-level examinations, usually in not more than 3 subjects. It is necessary to have A-levels in order to go to a university or polytechnic.<br />
In Scotland students take the SCE examinations. A year later, they can take examinations called HIGHERS, after which they can either go straight to a university or spend a further year at school and take the Certificate of Sixth Year Studies. In Scotland the university system is differ&not;ent to that in England and Wales. Courses usually last four years rather than three and students study a larger number of subjects as part of their degree.<br />
In the US school examinations are not as important as they are in Britain. Students in High Schools do have exams at the end of their last two years, but these final exams are considered along with the work that the students have done during the school years. <br />
Social events and ceremonies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
In American high schools there is a formal ceremony for Graduation. Students wear a special cap and gown and receive a diploma from the head of the school. Students often buy a class ring to wear, and a yearbook, containing pictures of their friends and teachers. There are also special social events at American schools. Sports events are popular, and cheer leaders lead the school in supporting the school team and singing the school song. At the end of their junior year, at age 17 or 18, students hold parties in the evening. The girls wear long evening dresses and the boys wear tuxedos (晚礼服).<br />
In Britain, there are no formal dances or social occasions associated with school life.' Some schools have SPEECH DAY at the end of the school year when prizes are given to the best students and speeches are made by the head teacher and sometimes an invited guest. However, in many British schools students and teachers organize informal dances for the older students.</p>
