<div>　　Part Ⅲ &nbsp;Reading Comprehension &nbsp;(55 minutes, 30 points, 1 for each)</div>
<div>　　Directions: There are five passages in this part. Each passage is followed by five questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C and D. Choose the best answer and mark the corresponding letter on the ANSWER SHEET with a single line through the center.</div>
<div>　　Passage One</div>
<div>　　Office jobs are among the positions hardest hit by compumation (计 算 机 自 动 化). Word processors and typists will lose about 93,000 jobs over the next few years, while 57,000 secretarial jobs will vanish. Blame the PC: Today, many executives type their own memos and carry there&quot; secretaries&quot; in the palms of their hands. Time is also hard for stock clerks, whose ranks are expected to decrease by 68,000. And employees in manufacturing firms and wholesalers are being replaced with computerized systems.</div>
<div>　　But not everyone who loses a job will end up in the unemployment line. Many will shift to growing positions within their own companies. When new technologies shook up the telecomm business, telephone operator Judy Dougherty pursued retraining. She is now a communications technician, earning about $ 64,000 per year. Of course, if you've been a tollbooth collector for the past 30 years, and you find yourself replaced by an E-Z Pass machine, it may be of little consolation(安慰) to know that the telecom field is booming.</div>
<div>　　And that's just it: The service economy is fading: welcome to the expertise(专门知识) economy. To succeed in the new job market, you must be able to handle complex problems. Indeed, all but one of the 50 highest-paying occupations---air-traffic controller---demand at least a bachelor's degree.</div>
<div>　　For those with just a high school diploma(毕业证书).It's going to get tougher to find a well-paying job. Since fewer factory and clerical jobs will be available. what's left be the jobs that compumations can't kill, computers cant clean offices, or for Alzheimer's patients(老年痴呆 病 人). But, since most people have the skills to fill those positions, the wages stay painfully low, meaning compumation could drive an even deeper wedge (楔 子) between the and poor, The best advice now, Never stop learning, and keep up with new technology.</div>
<div>　　For busy adults of course that can be tough, The good news is that very technology that's reducing so many jobs is a making it easier to go back to school without having to sit in a classroom. So called internet distance learning is hot, with more than three million students currently enrolled, and it's gaining credibility with employers.</div>
<div>　　Are you at risk of losing your job to a computer ？ Check the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Outlook Handbook, which is available online at bls.gov.</div>
<div>　　31、Prom the first paragraph we can infer that all of the following persons are easily thrown into unemployment EXCEPT.</div>
<div>　　A secretaries &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B stock clerks &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C managers &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D wholesalers</div>
<div>　　32、In the second paragraph the anther mentions the tollbooth collector to</div>
<div>　　A mean he will get benefits from the telecomm fled</div>
<div>　　B show he is too old to shift to a new position</div>
<div>　　C console him on having been replaced by a machine</div>
<div>　　D blame the PC for his unemployment</div>
<div>　　33、By saying &quot; ┅ compumation could drive an even deeper wedge between the rich and poor &quot;(line 5. Para 4 )the author means</div>
<div>　　A people are getting richer and richer</div>
<div>　　B there will be a small gap between rich and poor</div>
<div>　　C the gap between rich and poor is getting larger an larger</div>
<div>　　D it's time to close up be gap between the rich and poor</div>
<div>　　34、What is the good news for those busy adults?</div>
<div>　　A They can still hold the job.</div>
<div>　　B They no longer need to care about computation.</div>
<div>　　C Distance learning can help them.</div>
<div>　　D Employers are gaining credibility with them.</div>
<div>　　35．What is the author's attitude towards computers？</div>
<div>　　A positive &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B negative &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C neutral &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D prejudiced</div>
<div>　　36．Which of the following might serve as the best title of passage？</div>
<div>　　A Blaming the PC</div>
<div>　　B The booming telecomm field</div>
<div>　　C Internet distance leaning</div>
<div>　　D Keeping up with compumation</div>
<div>　　Passage Two</div>
<div>　　Tens of thousands of 18 year olds will graduate this year and be handed meaningless diplomas. These diplomas won't look any different from awarded their luckier classmates Their validity will be questioned only when their employers discover the these graduates are semiliterate(半文盲)</div>
<div>　　Eventually a fortunate few will find their way into educational - repair - adult - literacy Programs, such as the one where I teach grammar and writing. There, high school graduates and high school dropouts pursuing graduate equivalency certificates will learn the skills they should have learned in school, They will discover they have been cheated by our educational system.</div>
<div>　　I will never forget a teacher when a senior had her for English. &quot;He sits in the back of the room talking to his friends &quot;.she told me &quot; Why don't you move him to the front row？&quot; I urged, believing the embarrassment would get him to settle down. Mrs. Stifter said,&quot;I don't move seniors. I flunk (使 ┅ 不 及 格) them.&quot; Our son's academic life flashed before my eyes. No teacher had ever threatened him. By the time I got home I was feeling pretty good this. It was a radical approach for these times, but well. Why not ？ &quot;She's going to flunk you &quot; I told my son.</div>
<div>　　I did not discuss it any further. Suddenly English became a priority (头 等 重 要) in his life. He finished out the semester with an A.</div>
<div>　　I know one example doesn't make a case, but at night I see a parade of students who are angry for having been passed along until they could no longer even pretend to keep up. Of average intelligence or better, they eventually quit school, concluding they were too dumb to finish. &quot;I should have been held back&quot; is a comment I hear frequently. Even sadder are those students who are high-school graduates who say to me after a few weeks of class. &quot;I don't know how I ever got a high-school diploma.&quot;</div>
<div>　　Passing students who have not mastered the work cheats them and the employers who expect graduates to have basic skills. We excuse this dishonest behavior by saying kids can't learn if they come from terrible environments. No one seems to stop to think that most kids don't put school first on their list unless they perceive something is at risk. They'd rather be sailing.</div>
<div>　　Many students I see at night have decided to make education a priority. They are motivated by the desire for a better job or the need to hang on to the one they've got. They have a healthy fear of failure.</div>
<div>　　People of all ages can rise above their problems, but they need to have a reason to do so. Yong people generally don't have the maturity to value education in the same way my adult students value it. But fear of failure can motivate both.</div>

<div>　Passage Three</div>
<div>　　When Thomas Keller, one of America's foremost chefs, announced that on Sept. I he would abolish the practice of tipping at Per Se. his luxury restaurant in New York City, and replace it with European-style service charge, I knew three groups would be opposed: customers, servers and restaurant owners. These three groups are all committed to tipping--as they quickly made clear on Web sites. To oppose tipping, it seems, is to be ant capitalist, and maybe even a little French..</div>
<div>　　But Mr. Keller is right to move away from tipping-and it's worth exploring why just about everyone else in the restaurant world is wrong to stick with the practice.</div>
<div>　　Customers believe in tipping because they think it makes economic sense. &quot;Waiters know that they won't get paid if they don't do a good job&quot; is how most advocates of the system would put it. To be sure, this is a tempting, apparently rational statement about economic theory, but it appears to have little applicability to the real world of restaurants.</div>
<div>　　Michael Lynn, an associate professor of consumer behavior and marketing at Cornell's School of Hotel Administration, has conducted dozens of students of tipping and has concluded that consumers assessments of the quality of service correlate weakly to the amount they tip.</div>
<div>　　Rather, customers are likely to tip more in response to servers touching them lightly and leaning forward next to the table to make conversation than to how often their water glass is refilled--in other words, customers tip more when they like the server, not when the service is good. Mr. Lynn's studies also indicate that male customers increase their tips for female servers while female customers increase their tips for male servers,.</div>
<div>　　What's more, consumers seem to forget that the tip increases as the bill increases. Thus, the tipping system is an open invitation to what restaurant professionals call &quot;upwelling&quot;: every bottle of imported water, every espresso and every cocktail is extra money in the server's pocket. Aggressive upwelling for tips is often rewarded while low-key, quality service often goes unrecognized.</div>
<div>　　In addition, the practice of tip pooling, which is the norm in fine-dining restaurants and is becoming more in every kind of restaurant above the level of a greasy spoon, has ruined whatever effect voting with your tip might have had on an individual waiter. In an unreasonable outcome, you are punishing the good waiters in the restaurant by not tipping the bad one. Indeed, there appear to be little connection between tipping and good service.</div>
<div>　　43.It may be inferred that a European-style service______.</div>
<div>　　A. is tipping-free　　　　　　　　　 B. charges little tip</div>
<div>　　C. is the author's initiative 　　　　　D. is offered at Per-se</div>
<div>　　44. Which of the following is NOT true according to the author.</div>
<div>　　A. Tipping is a common practice in the restaurant world.</div>
<div>　　B. Waiters don't care about tipping</div>
<div>　　C. Customers generally believe in tipping.</div>
<div>　　D. Tipping has little connection with the quality of service.</div>
<div>　　45.According to Michael Lynn's studies, waiters will likely get more tips if they______</div>
<div>　　A. have performed good service</div>
<div>　　B. frequently refill customers' water glass</div>
<div>　　C. win customers' favor</div>
<div>　　D. serve customers of the same sex</div>
<div>　　46.We may infer from the context that &quot;upwelling&quot;(Line 2, Para 6) probably means ________</div>
<div>　　A. selling something up</div>
<div>　　B. selling something fancy</div>
<div>　　C. selling something unnecessary</div>
<div>　　D. selling something more expensive</div>
<div>　　47.What's the author's attitude towards tipping?</div>
<div>　　A. cautious</div>
<div>　　B. indifferent</div>
<div>　　C. generous</div>
<div>　　D. reasonable</div>
<div>　　48. This passage is mainly about __________</div>
<div>　　A. reasons to abolish the practice of tipping</div>
<div>　　B. economic sense of tipping</div>
<div>　　C. consumers' attitudes towards tipping</div>
<div>　　D. tipping for good service</div>
<div>　　Passage Four</div>
<div>　　&quot;I promise.&quot; &quot;I swear to you it'll never happen again.&quot; &quot;I give you my word.&quot; &quot;Honestly. Believe me.&quot; Sure, I trust. Why not? I teach English composition at a private college. With a certain excitement and intensity. I read my students' essays, hoping to find the person behind the pen. As each semester progresses, plagiarism（剽窃）appears. Not only is my intelligence insulted as one assumes I won't detect a polished piece of prose from an otherwise-average writer, but I feel a sadness that a student has resorted to buying a paper from a peer. Writers have styles like fingerprints and after several assignments, I can match a student's work with his or her name even if it's missing from the upper left-hand corner.</div>
<div>　　Why is learning less important than a higher grade-point average（GPA）? When we're threatened or sick, we make conditional promises. &quot;If you let me pass math I will &hellip;.&quot; &quot;Lord, if you get me over this before the big homecoming game I'll&hellip;.&quot; Once the situation is behind us, so are the promises. Human nature? Perhaps, but we do use that clich&eacute;（陈词滥调）to get us out of uncomfortable bargains. Divine interference during distress is asked; gratitude is unpaid. After all, few fulfill the contract, so why should anyone be the exception. Why not ?</div>
<div>　　Six years ago, I took a student before the dean. He had turned in an essay with the vocabulary and sentence structure of PhD thesis. Up until that time, both his out-of-class and in-class work were borderline passing.</div>
<div>　　I questioned the person regarding his essay and he swore it I'd understand this copy would not have the time and attention an out-of-class paper is given, but &nbsp;he had already a finished piece so he understood what was asked. He sat one hour, then turned in part of a page of unskilled writing and faulty logic. I confronted him with both essays. &quot;I promise&hellip;., I'm not lying. I swear to you that I wrote the essay. I'm just nervous today.&quot;</div>
<div>　　The head of the English department agreed with my finding, and the meeting with the dean had the boy's parents present. After an hour of discussion, touching on eight of the boy's previous essays and his grade-point average, which indicated he was already on academic probation（留校察看）, the dean agreed that the student had plagiarized. His parents protested, &quot;He's only a child&quot; and we instructors are wiser and should be compassionate. College people are not really children and most times would resent being labeled as such&hellip;. Except in this uncomfortable circumstance.</div>
<div>　　49. According to the author, students commit plagiarism mainly for_____.</div>
<div>　　A．money &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B．degree &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C．higher GPA &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D．reputation</div>
<div>　　50.How does the author know that his students are cheating?</div>
<div>　　A. He insulted the students</div>
<div>　　B. He compares the handwriting of his students' signatures</div>
<div>　　C. He knows the students' writing style</div>
<div>　　D. He discovers the missing names from the upper left-hand cover</div>
<div>　　51.the sentence &quot; Once the situation is behind us, so are the promises' implies that_________.</div>
<div>　　A．students usually keep their promises</div>
<div>　　B．some students tend to break their promises</div>
<div>　　C．the promises are always behind the situation</div>
<div>　　D．we cannot judge the situation in advance, as we do to the promises</div>
<div>　　52.The &quot;borderline passing&quot;（Line 3,Para.3）probably means____________.</div>
<div>　　A．fairly good &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B．extremely poor</div>
<div>　　C．above average &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D．below average</div>
<div>　　53.The boy's parents thought their son should be excused mainly because_______________.</div>
<div>　　A．teachers should be compassionate</div>
<div>　　B．he was only a child</div>
<div>　　C．instructors were wiser</div>
<div>　　D．he was threatened</div>
<div>　　54. Which of the following might serve as the title of this passage?</div>
<div>　　A．Human Nature &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B．Conditional Promises</div>
<div>　　C．How to Detect Cheating &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D．The Sadness of Plagiarism</div>
<div>Passage Five</div>
<div>　　Names have gained increasing importance in the competitive world of higher education. As colleges strive for market share, they are looking for names that project the image they want or reflect the changes they hope to make. Trenton. State College, for example, became the College of New Jersey nine years ago when it began raising admissions standards and appealing to students from throughout the state.</div>
<div>　　&quot;All I hear in higher education is, 'Brand, brand, brand' &quot; said Tim Westerbeck, who specializes in branding and is managing director of Lipman Hearne, a marketing firm based in Chicago that works with universities and other nonprofit organizations. &quot;There has been a sea change over the last 10 years. Marketing used to be almost a dirty word in higher education.&quot;</div>
<div>　　Not all efforts at name changes are successful, of course. In 1997, the New School for Social Research became New School University to reflect its growth into a collection of eight colleges, offering a list of majors that includes psychology, music, urban studies and management. But New Yorkers continued to call it the New School.</div>
<div>　　Now, after spending an undisclosed sum on an online survey and a marketing consultant's creation of &quot;haming structures.&quot; &quot;brand architecture&quot; and &quot; identity systems,&quot; the university has come up with a new name: the New School. Beginning Monday, it will adopt new logon (标 识), banners, business cards and even new names for the individual colleges, all to include the words &quot;the New School.&quot;</div>
<div>　　Changes in names generally reveal significant shifts in how a college wants to be perceived. In altering its name from Cal State. Hayward, to Cal State, East Bay, the university hoped to project its expanding role in two mostly suburban countries east of San Francisco.</div>
<div>　　The University of Southern Colorado, a state institution, became Colorado State University at Pucblo two years ago, hoping to highlight many internal changes, including offering more graduate programs and setting higher admissions standards.</div>
<div>　　Beaver College turned itself into Arcadia University in 2001 for several reasons: to break the connection with its past as a women's college, to promote its growth into a full-fledged(完 全 成 熟 的) university and officials acknowledged, to eliminate some jokes about the college's old name on late-night television and &quot;morning zoo&quot; radio shows.</div>
<div>　　Many college officials said changing a name and image could produce substantial results. At Arcadia, in addition to the rise in applications, the average students' test score has increased by 60 points, Juli Roebeck, an Arcadia spokeswoman said.</div>
<div>　　55. which of the following is NOT the reason for colleges to change their names？</div>
<div>　　A They prefer higher education competition</div>
<div>　　B They try to gain advantage in market share.</div>
<div>　　C They want to project their image.</div>
<div>　　D They hope to make some changes.</div>
<div>　　56. It is implied that one of the most significant changes in highter education in the past decade is</div>
<div>　　A the brand.</div>
<div>　　B the college names</div>
<div>　　C the concept of marketing</div>
<div>　　D list of majors.</div>
<div>　　57.The phrase &quot;come up with&quot;(Line 3 Para 4)probably means</div>
<div>　　A catch up with</div>
<div>　　B deal with</div>
<div>　　C put forward</div>
<div>　　D come to the realization</div>
<div>　　58 The case of name changing from Cal State Hayward to Cal State indicates that the university</div>
<div>　　A is perceived by the society</div>
<div>　　B hopes to expand its influence</div>
<div>　　C prefers to reform its reaching programs</div>
<div>　　D expects to enlarge its campus</div>
<div>　　59.According to the spokeswoman the name change of Beaver College</div>
<div>　　A turns out very successful</div>
<div>　　B fails to attain its goal</div>
<div>　　C has eliminated some jokes</div>
<div>　　D has transformed its status</div>
<div>　　60.What is the attitude of the author toward name change?</div>
<div>　　A neutral &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B indifferent</div>
<div>　　C suspicious &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; D objective</div>

<div>　　The first great rush of population to the far west was drawn to the mountainous regions, where gold was found in California in 1848, in Colorado and Nevada ten years later, in Montana and Wyoming in the l860s, and in the Black Hills of the Dakota country in the l870s. Miners opened up the country，established communities and laid the foundations for more permanent settlements. Yet even while digging in the hills, some settlers perceived the region's farming and stock-raising possibilities. Eventually, though a few communities continued to be devoted almost exclusively to minimal, the real wealth of Montana, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, and California proved to be in the grass and soil.</div>
