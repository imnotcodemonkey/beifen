<p>　　Part Ⅲ Reading Comprehension (45minutes, 30points)</p>
<p>　　Directions: There are 5 passages in this part. Each passage is  followed by  6 questions or unfinished statements. For each of them  there are 4 choices  marked A, B, C and D. Choose the best one and mark  the corresponding letter with  a single bar across the square brackets  on your machine-scoring ANSWER  SHEET.</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>Passage one</p>
<p>　　Now York&rsquo;s WCBS puts it in a way that just can&rsquo;t be better expressed: &ldquo;It  was an accident waiting to happen&rdquo;.</p>
<p>　　15-year-old Alexa Longueira was wandering along the street in  Staten  Island, obliviously tapping text message into her phone as she  walked.  Distracted by her phone, she failed to notice the open manhole  (下水道窨井) in her  path, and plunged into it, taking an unprepared bath of  raw sewage along with  receiving moderate injuries. Longueira called the  dive &ldquo;really gross, shocking  and scary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>　　It&rsquo;s not all Longueira&rsquo;s fault. The manhole shouldn&rsquo;t have been  left  uncovered and unattended, and no warning signs or hazard cones had  been set  Protection (DEP), who was preparing to flush the sewage,  helped her out, and the  department later issued a formal apology for  the incident.</p>
<p>　　Nonetheless, observers are harshly divided over who is to blame  here. The  DEP is certainly at fault for failing t secure the manhole,  but to what extent  should the girl be held accountable for failure to  be aware of her surroundings?  If she had stepped into traffic and been  hit by a car, would her reaction (that  is: anger and a potential  lawsuit) be any different?</p>
<p>　　Detachment from one&rsquo;s environment due to electronic gadgets is a  growing  problem-and a hazardous one. The government is even trying to  get involved, with  multiple laws on the books across the country  outlawing cell phone use and text  messaging while operating a motor  vehicle in the wake of serious accidents  involving distracted drivers.  New York Senator Kruger even tried to criminalize  the use of handheld  devices (including phones, music players, and game players)  by  pedestrians while they are crossing streets in major New York cities,  due to  concerns over the number of auto vs. pedestrian accidents.</p>
<p>　　Following a substantial outcry, that legislation appears never to have been  formally introduced. But did Kruger have a point?</p>
<p>　　What interested me, at least, is the end of the story above that  Longueira  lost a shoe in the sewage. But since other things are not  reported as lost, I&rsquo;m  guessing she appears to have managed to keep her  grip on her phone during the  accident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　　31. By &ldquo;It was an accident waiting to happen&rdquo;, New York&rsquo;s WCBS meant that  .</p>
<p>　　A. the accident should have been avoidable</p>
<p>　　B. this kind of accidents happen frequently</p>
<p>　　C. somebody was glad to see what would happen</p>
<p>　　D. an open manhole is sure a trap for careless pedestrians</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　32. When the girl fell into the open manhole, she .</p>
<p>　　A. was seriously hurt B. was frightened</p>
<p>　　C. took a bath in the raw sewage D. cried help to the DEP worker</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　33. According to the author, who was to blame for the accident?</p>
<p>　　A. The girl herself B. The DEP worker</p>
<p>　　C. Both of them D. Nobody</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　34. According to the passage, which of the following is illegal in the  U.S.?</p>
<p>　　A. Talking on a cell phone while driving</p>
<p>　　B. Text messaging while walking across a street</p>
<p>　　C. Operating music players while driving</p>
<p>　　D. Operating game players while walking across a street</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　35. The phrase &ldquo;in the wake of&rdquo; (Para.5) is closest in meaning to &ldquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>　　A. in view of B. on condition of</p>
<p>　　C. as far as D. with regard to</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　36. The author found it funny that the girl had .</p>
<p>　　A. lost a shoe in the sewage in the accident</p>
<p>　　B. reported nothing lost after the accident</p>
<p>　　C. got a firm hold of her phone during the accident</p>
<p>　　D. managed to keep herself upright in the manhole</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Passage Two</p>
<p>　　According to a study, intellectual activities make people eat more  than  when just resting. This has shed new light on brain food. This  finding might  also help explain the obesity epidemic of a society in  which people often  sit.</p>
<p>　　Researchers split 14 university student volunteers into three  groups for a  45-minute session of either relaxing in a sitting  position, reading and  summarizing a text, or completing a series of  memory, attention, and alert tests  on the computer. After the sessions,  the participants were invited to eat as  much as they pleased.</p>
<p>　　Though the study involved a very small number of participants, the  results  were stark. The students who had done the computer tests downed  253 more  calories or 29.4 percent more than the couch potatoes. Those  who had summarized  a text consumed 203 more calories than the resting  group.</p>
<p>　　Blood samples taken before, during, and after revealed that  intellectual  work cause much bigger fluctuations in glucose (葡萄糖)  levels than rest periods,  perhaps owing to the stress of thinking.</p>
<p>　　The researchers figure the body reacts to these fluctuations by  demanding  food to restore glucose-the brain&rsquo;s fuel. Glucose is  converted by the body from  carbohydrates (碳水化合物) and is supplied to the  brain via the bloodstream. The  brain cannot make glucose and so needs a  constant supply. Brain cells need twice  as much energy as other cells  in the body.</p>
<p>　　Without exercise to balance the added intake, however, such &ldquo;brain  food&rdquo; is  probably not smart. Various studies in animals have shown that  consuming fewer  calories overall leads to sharper brains and longer  life, and most researchers  agree that the findings apply, in general,  to humans.</p>
<p>　　And, of course, eating more can make you fat.</p>
<p>　　&ldquo;Caloric overcompensation following intellectual work, combined  with the  fact that we are less physically active when doing  intellectual tasks, could  contribute to the obesity epidemic currently  observed in industrialized  countries,&rdquo; said lead researcher  Jean-Philippe Chaput at Laval University in  Quebec City, Canada. &ldquo;This  is a factor that should not be ignored, considering  that more and more  people hold jobs of an intellectual nature,&rdquo; the researcher  concluded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　　37. The passage mainly tells us that .</p>
<p>　　A. consuming fewer calories can lead to sharper brains</p>
<p>　　B. thinking consumed more calories than resting</p>
<p>　　C. resting more can make people fat</p>
<p>　　D. brain cells need more energy than other cells in the body</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　　38. It is implied that to avoid obesity, people who have to sit long should  .</p>
<p>　　A. think more and eat less B. increase the intake of vitamins</p>
<p>　　C. skip some meals D. eat less potatoes</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　　39. The word &ldquo;stark&rdquo; in the 3rd paragraph is closest in meaning to &ldquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>　　　A. negative B. obscure C. absolute D. ambiguous</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　40. According to the research, which of the following activities consumed  the most calories?</p>
<p>　　A. Relaxing in a sitting position</p>
<p>　　B. Reading professional books</p>
<p>　　C. Summarizing a text</p>
<p>　　D. Completing tests on the computer</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　41. According to the passage, eating less may make people .</p>
<p>　　A. smarter B. less intelligent</p>
<p>　　C. more emotional D. live a shorter life</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　42. One of the reasons for the obesity epidemic currently observed in  industrialized countries is that in these countries .</p>
<p>　　A. people take different exercises</p>
<p>　　B. fewer people watch their weight</p>
<p>　　C. fewer people hold physical jobs</p>
<p>　　D. foods are much cheaper</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passage three</p>
<p>　　One of the simple pleasures of a lazy summer day is to be able to  enjoy a  refreshing slice of watermelon either at the beach, at a  picnic, or fresh from  the farmer&rsquo;s market. Delicious and nutritious,  watermelon is one of those  guilt-free foods we can all enjoy: one cup  of watermelon packs only about 50  calories! Watermelons are not only  cooling treats for when the mercury starts to  rise; they are also  loaded with healthy nutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin C,  lycopene  (番茄红素)， and etc. Vitamins A and C and lycopene are antioxidants, which   are substances that work to help get rid of the harmful effects of   substances.</p>
<p>　　Research has suggested that a diet high in fruits and vegetables  that have  plenty of antioxidants can reduce the risk of heart disease,  some cancers, and  some other dangerous diseases. A cup of watermelon  provides 25 of the  recommended daily value of vitamin C and 6 of the  recommended daily value of  vitamin A. Additionally, researchers have  found that lycopene, a nutrient most  traditionally associated with  tomatoes, is found in equal or greater quantities  in watermelon.</p>
<p>　　Watermelons also provide significant amounts of vitamin B6 and  vitamin B1,  both of which are necessary for energy production. In  combination with the  minerals and vitamins already described, these B  vitamins add to the high  nutrient richness of watermelon. Due to its  high water content(watermelon is 92  water by weight) and low calorie  count, watermelon is a good choice to satisfy  your hunger while you try  to eat a healthy diet. Think of them as nature&rsquo;s  answer to the heavily  marketed &ldquo;vitamin water&rdquo; craze.</p>
<p>　　Beside the textured, watery flesh of the fruit, watermelon seeds  are also  widely eaten as a snack. They are rich in iron and protein and  are often pressed  for oil or roasted and seasoned.</p>
<p>　　So if you are planning on dining outdoor this summer, or simply  looking for  a quick and convenient refreshment to serve to unexpected  or reckless children,  reach for watermelon. The kids will enjoy its  crisp taste and messy juices, the  adults will enjoy its refreshing  flavors, and everyone will benefit from its  nutritious value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　　43. We don&rsquo;t feel guilt even if we eat more watermelon because .</p>
<p>　　A. it is delicious B. it is nutritious</p>
<p>　　C. it contains low calories D. it contains antioxidants</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　44. The phrase &ldquo;when the mercury starts to rise&rdquo; (Para.1) probably means &ldquo;  &rdquo;.</p>
<p>　　A. in summer evenings B. on sunny days</p>
<p>　　C. when people are thirsty D. when it is getting hot</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passage Four</p>
<p>　　Initial voyages into space introduced questions scientists had  never before  considered. Could an astronaut swallow food in zero  gravity? To keep things  simple, astronauts on the Project Mercury ate  foods squeezed out of tubes. It  was like serving them baby food in a  toothpaste container.</p>
<p>　　But these early tube meals were flavorless, and astronauts dropped  too many  pounds. &ldquo;We know that astronauts have lost weight in every  American and Russian  manned flight,&rdquo; wrote NASA scientists Malcolm  Smith in 1969. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know  why.&rdquo; Feeding people in space was not as  easy as it looked.</p>
<p>　　Floating around in space isn&rsquo;t as relaxing as it might sound.  Astronauts  expend a lot of energy and endure extreme stresses on their  bodies. Their  dietary requirements are therefore different from those  of their gravity-bound  counterparts on Earth. For example, they need  extra calcium to compensate for  bone loss. &ldquo;A low-salt diet helps slow  the process, but there are no  refrigerators in space, and salt is often  used to help preserve foods,&rdquo; says  Vickie Kloeris of NASA. &ldquo;We have to  be very careful of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>　　By the Apollo missions, NASA had developed a nutritionally balanced  menu  with a wide variety of options. Of course, all the items were  freeze-dried or  heat-treated to kill bacteria, and they didn&rsquo;t look  like regular food.</p>
<p>　　Today, the most elaborate outer-space meals are consumed in the   International Space Station (ISS), where astronauts enjoy everything  from steak  to chocolate cake. The ISS is a joint venture between the  U.S. and Russia, and  diplomatic guidelines dictate the percentage of  food an astronaut must eat from  each country. NASA&rsquo;s food laboratory  has 185 different menu items, Russia offers  around 100, and when Japan  sent up its first crew member in 2008, about 30  dishes came with him.  Due to dietary restrictions and storage issues, astronauts  still can&rsquo;t  eat with whatever they want whenever they feel like it.</p>
<p>　　In 2008, NASA astronaut and ISS crew member Sandra Magnus became  the first  person to try to cook a meal in space. It took her over an  hour to cook onions  and garlic in the space station&rsquo;s food warmer, but  she managed to create a truly  delicious dish: grilled tuna(金枪鱼) in a  lemon-garlic sauce-eaten from a bag, of  course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　　49. Which of the following is true about the early space meals?</p>
<p>　　A. They had to be eaten from a bag.</p>
<p>　　B. They tasted better than they looked.</p>
<p>　　C. They could not make eating as easy as possible.</p>
<p>　　D. They were not nutritious enough for astronauts.</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　50. It seems that astronauts&rsquo; weight loss .</p>
<p>　　A. was an unusual problem among astronauts</p>
<p>　　B. was what puzzled the early scientists</p>
<p>　　C. caused new problems in space flights</p>
<p>　　D. drew the attention of the general public</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　51. According to Vickie Kloeris, serving a low-salt diet in space .</p>
<p>　　A. is easier said than done B. is not absolutely necessary</p>
<p>　　C. has worked as expected D. will be the future trend</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　52. In the International Space Station, .</p>
<p>　　A. there is enough space to store enough foods for astronauts</p>
<p>　　B. there is a selection of flavored foods from a dozen countries</p>
<p>　　C. astronauts in general prefer foods from their own countries</p>
<p>　　D. astronauts&rsquo; need to eat their favorite foods can&rsquo;t always be met</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　53. It can be learned that Sandra Magnus&rsquo; cooking in space .</p>
<p>　　A. left much to be desired B. wasn&rsquo;t worth the effort</p>
<p>　　C. was quite satisfactory D. has inspired the others</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　54. The passage mainly introduces .</p>
<p>　　A. the variety of food options in space</p>
<p>　　B. the dietary need of astronauts in space</p>
<p>　　C. the problems of living in the space station</p>
<p>　　D. the improvement of food offered in space</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passage Five</p>
<p>　　Is it possible to be both fat and fit-not just fit enough to  exercise, but  fit enough to live as long as someone a lot lighter? Not  according to a 2004  study from the Harvard School of Public Health  which looked at 115,000 nurses  aged between 30 and 55. Compared with  women who were both thin and active,  obese(overweight) but active women  had a mortality rate that was 91 higher.  Though far better than the  inactive obese (142％ higher), they were still worse  off than the  inactive lean (5％ higher). A similar picture emerged in 2008 after   researchers examined 39,000 women with an average age of 54. Compared  with  active women of normal weight, the active but overweight were 54％  more likely to  develop heart disease.</p>
<p>　　That&rsquo;s settled, then. Or is it? Steven Blair, a professor of  exercise  science at the University of South Carolina, describes the  official focus on  obesity as an &ldquo;obsession&hellip; and it&rsquo;s not grounded in  solid data&rdquo;.</p>
<p>　　Blair&rsquo;s most fascinating study, in the Journal of American Medical   Association in 2007, took 2,600 people aged 60 and above, of various  degrees of  fatness, and tested their fitness on the exercise device,  rather than asking  them to quantify it themselves. This is an unusually  rigorous approach, he  claims. Since many rival surveys ask  participants to assess their own fitness,  or ignore it as a factor  altogether.</p>
<p>　　&ldquo;There is an &lsquo;association&rsquo; between obesity and fitness,&rdquo; he agrees,  &ldquo;but it  is not perfect. As you progress towards overweight, the  percentage of  individuals who are fit does go down. But here&rsquo;s a shock:  among classⅡ obese  individuals [with a body mass index between 35 and  39.9], about 40％ or 45％ are  still fit. You simply cannot tell by  looking whether someone is fit or not. When  we look at these mortality  rates in fat people who are fit, we see that the  harmful effect of fat  just disappears: their death rate during the next decade  is half that  of the normal weight people who are unfit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>　　One day-probably about a hundred years from now-this fat-but-fit  question  will be answered without the shadow of a doubt. In the  meantime, is there  anything that all the experts agree on? Oh yes:  however much your body weighs,  you&rsquo;ll live longer if you move it around  a bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　　55. It can be learned that the 2008 research .</p>
<p>　　A. posed a challenge to the 2004 study</p>
<p>　　B. confirmed the findings of the 2004 study</p>
<p>　　C. solved the problems left behind by the 2004 study</p>
<p>　　D. had a different way of thinking from the 2004 study</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　56. Steven Blair probably describes the previous studies as .</p>
<p>　　A. unreliable B. uncreative C. unrealistic D. untraditional</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　57. The major difference between Blair&rsquo;s study and the previous research is  that .</p>
<p>　　A. Blair excluded the participants&rsquo; fitness as a factor</p>
<p>　　B. Blair guessed the participants&rsquo; fitness after weighing them</p>
<p>　　C. Blair required the participants to assess their own fitness</p>
<p>　　D. Blair evaluated the participants&rsquo; fitness through physical tests</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　58. Blair&rsquo;s study proves that .</p>
<p>　　A. the weight problem should be taken seriously</p>
<p>　　B. weight and fitness are strongly connected</p>
<p>　　C. it is possible to be both fat and fit</p>
<p>　　D. fat people have a higher death rate</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　59. It can be seen from the description of these studies that the author  .</p>
<p>　　A. shows no preference for any researcher</p>
<p>　　B. finds no agreement between the researchers</p>
<p>　　C. obviously favors the Blair study</p>
<p>　　D. obviously favors the Harvard study</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　60. The purpose of writing this passage is to .</p>
<p>　　A. call on people to pay attention to weight problem</p>
<p>　　B. present the different findings of various weight studies</p>
<p>　　C. compare the strength and weakness of different studies</p>
<p>　　D. offer suggestions on how to remain fit and live longer</p>

<p>　　Most children with healthy appetites are ready to eat almost  anything that  is offered to them. A child rarely dislikes food 61 it is  badly cooked. The 62 a  meal is cooked and served is most important and  an 63 served meal will improve a  child&rsquo;s appetite. Never ask a child  64 he likes or dislikes a food and never 65  likes and dislikes in front  of him or allow anybody else to do so. If the father  says he hates fat  meat or the mother 66 vegetables, in the child&rsquo;s hearing he is  67 to  copy this procedure. Take it 68 granted that he likes everything and he   probably will. Nothing healthful should be omitted from the meal  because of a 69  dislike. At meal times it is a good 70 to give a child a  small portion and let  him come back for a second helping rather than  give him as 71 as he is likely to  eat all at once. Do not talk too much  to the child during meal times, but let  him go on with his food; and  do not 72 him to leave the table immediately after  a meal or he will  soon learn to swallow his food 73 he can hurry back to his  toys. Under  74 circumstances must a child be coaxed (哄骗) 75 forced to eat.</p>

<p>　　Exposition 2010 Shanghai China will centre on innovation and  interaction.  Innovation is the soul, while cultural interaction is an  important mission of  the World Expositions. In the new era, Expo 2010  Shanghai China will contribute  to human-centered development,  scientific and technological innovation, cultural  diversity and win-win  cooperation for a better future, thus composing a melody  with the key  notes of highlighting innovation and interaction in the new  century.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　　Part VI</p>
<p>　　Recently, with the rapid increase of automobiles in big cities of  China,  more and more people have become concerned about the problem of  air pollution  and energy consumption. Many people are worried that if  we go on emitting tons  of harmful gases and consuming huge quantities  of energy, we will have to face  serious air pollution and shortage of  energy in the near future. Thus, it is the  high time that we advocated  low carbon living to protect our environment.</p>
<p>　　To live a low carbon life, it is highly important for every one of  us to  take immediate actions to reduce the emission of co2.. First,  public  transportations such as buses and subways should be encouraged,  and the number  and use of private cars should be restricted, for all  motorized travel is  carbon-intensive and cheaper. Second, some energy  conservation habits should be  formed including using efficient light  bulbs, switching off all appliances when  you're not using them, and  etc. Third, the use of disposable containers and  plastic bags should be  avoided.</p>
<p>　　As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I&rsquo;ll live a low carbon life in the  following ways.  For one thing, I&rsquo;ll take stairs instead of lifts and  ride to work whenever I  can. For another, I&rsquo;ll bring my own bag when I  go shopping in the supermarkets.  I strongly believe if everyone can do a  little to reduce the emission of co2,  all together, we&rsquo;ll make a big  difference.</p>
